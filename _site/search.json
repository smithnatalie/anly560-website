    "text": "What is a Time Series?\n\nAny metric that is measured over regular time intervals makes a Time Series.\n\nExample: Weather data, Stock prices, Industry forecasts, etc are some of the common ones.\n\nThe analysis of experimental data that have been observed at different points in time leads to new and unique problems in statistical modeling and inference.\nThe obvious correlation introduced by the sampling of adjacent points in time can severely restrict the applicability of the many conventional statistical methods traditionally dependent on the assumption that these adjacent observations are independent and identically distributed.\n\n\n\nData Visualization with Stock Data\nIn this section, I am going to be taking a look at the stock prices for three different oil and gas corporations between 2012 and 2022. The corporations being analyzed are:\n\nExxonMobil (XOM)\nChevron (CVX)\nShell (SHEL)\n\n\n\n\nBelow, the head of the data can be seen, which shows the first week of stock prices being analyzed for each of the three corporations.\n\n\n                XOM      CVX     SHEL      Dates       date\n2012-10-01 59.73256 76.87349 39.79350 2012-10-01 2012-10-01\n2012-10-02 59.68054 77.33902 40.08012 2012-10-02 2012-10-02\n2012-10-03 59.66750 76.14571 39.84510 2012-10-03 2012-10-03\n2012-10-04 60.00585 76.80795 40.01134 2012-10-04 2012-10-04\n2012-10-05 60.22059 77.03740 40.05145 2012-10-05 2012-10-05\n2012-10-08 60.30517 77.11608 40.06292 2012-10-08 2012-10-08\n\n\nThe time series plot below shows how each of the three stocks have changed between 2012 and 2022. Chevron appears to be the clear winner, with significantly higher closing prices compared to Shell and ExxonMobil.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the next time interactive series plot, we can hover over different points in time to get more in depth information about the specific closing prices for each of the three corporations on specific dates.\nOne of the clearest takeaways from this plot is the nosedive in closing prices for all three corporations on March 20th, 2020, which is right around when the COVID-19 pandemic began in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin Plot Using plotly\nHere, I will take a look at a single stock price for Bitcoin.
