    "text": "Background\nOver the last 100 years, the impact of climate change on the world’s ecosystem has been observed in a variety of different areas, including new record-high temperature increases year after year, droughts, loss of wildlife habitats and resources, more frequent and severe natural disasters and storms, worsening air quality, and more, much of which is still yet to seen in the coming decades.\nIn the United States, scientists are often looking at Florida when observing both current and future consequences of climate change, most notably rapid sea level rise and increased flooding that make the southern, peninsular state particularly vulnerable. Many areas of southern Florida, especially extremely popular and historic cities like Miami Beach and landmarks like the Florida Keys, are even theorized to be partially or completely submerged underwater within decades without human intervention to rapidly protect infrastructure [1].\n\n\nGuiding Questions for Analysis\nIn this project, I will be using time series analysis to study the the current consequences of climate change and predict its potential impacts on the future by zooming in on the state of Florida and answering the following questions:\n\nHow has Florida’s temperature changed over the last few decades?\n\nHave averages temperatures continued to trend upwards?\nIs Florida experiencing consistent record-high temperatures in the summer year after year?\n\nIs Florida seeing consistent temperature increases in every season compared to previous years?\n\nFor example, are winters in Florida in the 2010s and 2020s consistently hotter than the Florida winters of previous decades?\n\nCan current climate data be used to predict future temperature trends in Florida in the coming decades?\nHas precipitation in Florida changed over the last few decades? Is the state seeing increased, decreased, or relatively constant levels of rain year after year?\nHave the number hurricanes and tropical storms affecting the state changed over the last few decades?\nHas the intensity and damage caused by major storms (particularly hurricanes and tropical storms) affecting the state increased?\nHas flooding overall in coastal Floridian cities and town changed over the years?\nHas the cost of repairing damage done by major storms, storm surge, and flooding increased over the last few decades?\nHow has climate change affected the cost of homes, home insurance, and/or flood insurance in coastal Floridian cities and towns?\nWhat is the extent to which Florida’s coastline has receded over the decades?\n\nIs the state experiencing coastal erosion at a faster pace than in previous decades?\nHow rapidly are local sea levels rising?"

    "text": "What is a Time Series?\n\nAny metric that is measured over regular time intervals makes a Time Series.\n\nExample: Weather data, Stock prices, Industry forecasts, etc are some of the common ones.\n\nThe analysis of experimental data that have been observed at different points in time leads to new and unique problems in statistical modeling and inference.\nThe obvious correlation introduced by the sampling of adjacent points in time can severely restrict the applicability of the many conventional statistical methods traditionally dependent on the assumption that these adjacent observations are independent and identically distributed.\n\n\n\nData Visualization with Stock Data\nIn this section, I am going to be taking a look at the stock prices for three different oil and gas corporations between 2012 and 2022. The corporations being analyzed are:\n\nExxonMobil (XOM)\nChevron (CVX)\nShell (SHEL)\n\n\n\n\nBelow, the head of the data can be seen, which shows the first week of stock prices being analyzed for each of the three corporations.\n\n\n                XOM      CVX     SHEL      Dates       date\n2012-10-01 59.73256 76.87349 39.79350 2012-10-01 2012-10-01\n2012-10-02 59.68054 77.33902 40.08012 2012-10-02 2012-10-02\n2012-10-03 59.66750 76.14571 39.84510 2012-10-03 2012-10-03\n2012-10-04 60.00585 76.80795 40.01134 2012-10-04 2012-10-04\n2012-10-05 60.22059 77.03740 40.05145 2012-10-05 2012-10-05\n2012-10-08 60.30517 77.11608 40.06292 2012-10-08 2012-10-08\n\n\nThe time series plot below shows how each of the three stocks have changed between 2012 and 2022. Chevron appears to be the clear winner, with significantly higher closing prices compared to Shell and ExxonMobil.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the next time interactive series plot, we can hover over different points in time to get more in depth information about the specific closing prices for each of the three corporations on specific dates.\nOne of the clearest takeaways from this plot is the nosedive in closing prices for all three corporations on March 20th, 2020, which is right around when the COVID-19 pandemic began in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin Plot Using plotly\nHere, I will take a look at a single stock price for Bitcoin.

Although it appears to be making a recovery, it is still far from where it was in 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following plot is a basic candlestick chart showing the last 30 opening and closing prices for Bitcoin, beginning in December 2022 and ending mid-January of 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotting Climate Data Using plotly\nIn the following plots, I will be taking a look at climate data in the Washington D.C. area for year of 2021.\nFirst, I will take a look at the changing precipitation levels in the area throughout the year as reported by the seven different stations across the DC area.\nThe stations are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         STATION                         NAME\n1    US1DCDC0009    WASHINGTON 2.0 SSW, DC US\n169  USC00186350 NATIONAL ARBORETUM DC, MD US\n440  US1DCDC0031    WASHINGTON 3.1 NNE, DC US\n737  US1DCDC0014     WASHINGTON 5.1 NW, DC US\n1095 USC00182325  DALECARLIA RESERVOIR, MD US\n1345 US1DCDC0026     WASHINGTON 2.6 NE, DC US\n1683 US1DCDC0034     WASHINGTON 1.9 NW, DC US\n\n\nIn the scatter plot below, the levels of precipitation across the year can be seen.\nHere, we can see that snow only fell in the DC area between January and February of 2021, with a peak of 2 inches on February 2nd.\nRain, as expected, fell in the area during every month of the year, with a peak of about 3.8 inches on August 20th."
