Helene quickly weakened to a tropical depression Friday afternoon as it accelerated northeast into southeast Alabama.  Storm total rainfall ranged from a half inch at Perry and to 9.56 inches at Apalachicola, Florida.  The highest sustained wind of 30 mph with a peak gust of 45 mph was recorded at Cape San Blas.  The lowest sea-level pressure was 1011 mb at Panama City.  

Coastal storm tides of two feet or less above astronomical tide levels were common, with only minor beach erosion reported.  The torrential rainfall caused extensive flooding throughout Franklin, Wakulla and Leon counties.  The flooding prompted city and county officials to close schools, universities and public offices and kept emergency crews busy rescuing stranded motorists.  Utility crews worked diligently to restore power to homes, and clearing streets and county roads of storm debris.  Numerous homes along the Sopchoppy River in Wakulla County were flooded, with secondary and county roads washed out.  The river crested at 34.9 feet, breaking the record of 34 feet in 1970.  Numerous homes in northern Wakulla County were affected when sinkholes backed up with flood waters.  Flooding was also reported at Walker Crossing and at the Wildwood Golf Course near Medart.  Nearly 70 streets in Tallahassee were impassable due to high water.  Over 100 homes in Leon County were affected by flood waters.  50 residents were evacuated from the flooded Carriage Estates mobile home park and another 20 were rescued from the Sandpebble Apartments in Tallahassee.  Scattered power outages left 5,000 homes without electricity in Leon and Wakulla counties when water-logged tree limbs were blown into power lines.  Minor flooding was reported in Bay, Jefferson, Calhoun, Madison and Gulf counties.

Numerous tornadoes were reported. In Franklin County, brief touchdowns at Alligator Point, Eastpoint and in several rural wooded areas.  In Wakulla County, two touchdowns, of which one destroyed several mobile homes.  In Jefferson County, two touchdowns which damaged two mobile homes, a barn and vehicle.  The counties of Bay, Calhoun, Franklin, Gulf, Jefferson, Leon and Wakulla were declared federal disaster areas.","",92

After landfall, Barry rapidly weakened to a tropical depression over southwest Alabama.  Maximum sustained winds prior to landfall were measured at 39 knots with a peak gust to 54 knots at the Gulf data buoy 42039 (85 nautical miles south of Apalachicola, Florida) during the late afternoon of 5 August.  As the center of Barry moved onshore, a peak wind gust of 55 knots was recorded at the Eglin AFB Range Station C-52 (10 miles northwest of Freeport, Florida, in Walton County) about 130 am CDT on 6 August.  At the same location, the lowest sea-level pressure recorded was 994.2 mb at 1247 am CDT.  Scattered wind damage was reported throughout Walton, Washington, Bay, Calhoun and Gulf counties as trees and limbs fell into power lines.  Over 40,000 homes were without power.  In Bay County, several homes were inundated by water due to roof damage.

Due to its slow motion toward the Florida Panhandle coast, rainbands affected the coastal areas as early as the late afternoon of 4 August, with the heaviest rainfall observed on 5-6 August.  Official storm totals ranged from 2.37 inches at Marianna  to 8.91 inches at Tallahassee, Florida.  An unofficial total of 11 inches was reported by WJHG-TV in Panama City, Florida.

Maximum storm tides ranged from a foot in coastal Franklin County, to three feet in coastal Walton County where minor beach erosion was reported.  Minor to no beach erosion was observed from coastal Bay, Gulf and Franklin counties.  

Significant flooding occurred in Leon County, including the Tallahassee area, as well as the northwest Apalachicola National Forest, where excessive rains flowed southward into the Cascade Lakes, Lake Bradford and Munson Slough.  The Munson Slough rose to its highest level since the 1994 floods.  Dozens of homes were affected, as well as horses, livestock, vehicles and equipment.  Numerous county and secondary roads across Walton, Washington, and Bay counties were closed to floodwaters.","",121

By sunrise, high end tropical storm force wind gusts of 60 to 70 mph were common from the mouth of Tampa Bay south to Charlotte Harbor.  Gabrielle continued to move northeast and made landfall, south of Venice, in Sarasota county, between 6:45 and 7:00 a.m. EST.  The lowest sea level pressure observed with landfalling Garbrielle was 983.1 millibars at the Venice C-MAN site at 7:00 a.m. EST.  At the Venice C-MAN site, a maximum wind gust of 73 mph from the northwest was observed at 9:00 a.m. EST as feeder bands on the storms northwest side began to move over southern Sarasota county.  Although storm total rainfall amounts of 5 to 7 inches from Gabrielle were common across Southwest and parts of West Central Florida, a maximum storm total rainfall amount of 11.65 inches was reported in Palmetto in Manatee county.

Maximum storm tides observed were around 6 feet near the mouth of the Peace River in Charlotte Harbor shortly after sunrise.  Total damage across the 15 county area of Southwest and West Central Florida from Gabrielle was estimated to be nearly 17 million dollars.
Gabrielle continued to move northeast across the Florida peninsula and was centered over central Polk county by mid afternoon of the 14th.  Winds across West central and Southwest Florida subsided to below tropical storm force by late afternoon.  However, wrap around western outer bands of Gabrielle continued to bring a second brush of low end tropical storm force wind gusts to Citrus, Sumter,  Hernando, Pasco and Hillsborough counties from 7 p.m. EST on September 14th, through 3 am EST on September 15th.

In Lee county, tropical storm wind gusts of 45 to 55 mph and flooding caused up to 5.7 million dollars in damage.  Most of the wind damage was caused to roof shingles, carports and lanais, mainly in the Cape Coral area.  Flooding caused major damage to nearly 100 homes and another 500 incurred minor flood damage, mainly due to storm tides of three to four feet along coastal areas from Ft. Myers Beach to Sanibel, Captiva and Pine Islands from sunrise through 1 pm EST.

In Charlotte county, tropical storm wind gusts of 55 to 65 mph were common from the barrier islands east into Charlotte Harbor where over one million dollars in damage was estimated from wind and flooding.  Most of the wind damage occurred to mobile home roofs, pool cages and downed trees, from Englewood east to Punta Gorda. Flooding caused major damage to several homes along the north end of Gasparilla Island north to Englewood Beach.  Also, flooding occurred in Charlotte Harbor and near the mouth of the Peace River due to mainly maximum storm tides of up to 6 feet around sunrise through late morning of the 14th.

In Sarasota county, tropical storm wind gusts of 60 to 70+ mph were common along the barrier islands east to the Interstate 75 corridor. Over two million dollars in damage was estimated primarily from wind.  Several homes from Englewood north to Venice and Osprey incurred roof, lanai and carport damage.  Hundreds of trees and power lines were also downed throughout Sarasota county by the high end tropical storm force winds.  A maximum storm tide, estimated at three to four feet, caused beach erosion and home flooding along Manasota Key, between Englewood and Venice in Sarasota County, as Gabrielle made landfall shortly after sunrise.

In Manatee county, tropical storm force northerly wind gusts of 60 to 70 mph were common along the barrier islands east to the Interstate 75 corridor.  A one to three mile wide swath of numerous downed trees extended from Palmetto south across east Bradenton to near the Sarasota - Bradenton airport.  Most of the trees were blown down from north to south across the county.  Ground and arial surveys indicated several alluvial downbursts mainly from Terra Ceia south across the western portion of Bradenton.  Wind damage in excess of one million dollars was estimated due to mainly roofs of homes, lanais, carports and downed trees.  Storm total rainfall of 8 to 10 inches was common which caused flooding to homes and business across most of Manatee county.

In DeSoto and Hardee counties, storm total rainfall five to seven inches caused county-wide flooding to homes and business, estimated at up to five million dollars.  Wind gusts of 45 to 55 mph were common throughout mid-morning to early afternoon of the 14th across Hardee and DeSoto counties where downed trees, minor roof and tile damage were common.

In Pinellas and Hillsborough counties, northeast wind gusts of 50 to 65 mph were common across most of Tampa Bay and the southern portions of the counties.  Storm tide values of up to three feet were common on the Pinellas county side (west) of Tampa Bay, from the Gandy Bridge south Point Pinellas.  Most wind damage and flooding were minor across Pinellas and Hillsborough counties.

In Pasco, Hernando, Citrus and Sumter counties, tropical storm force winds of 40 to 50 mph, downed numerous trees and damaged several poorly constructed or weathered mobile homes across the four county area through the morning and late evening of the 14th.

At least four, seperate and distinct, narrow sporadic tornadoes occurred with the outer spiral bands on the east side of Gabrielle.

Major beach erosion occurred on Dauphin Island and along the beaches of Baldwin county in  Alabama, as well as along the Florida panhandle coastline from Pensacola Beach to Navarre Beach.  
Major storm tide flooding occurred in Mobile County Alabama on the west end of Dauphin Island,  along low lying coastal areas of the southern part of the county, and along the Causeway that crosses the northern part of Mobile Bay.  Storm tide flooding also occurred in Baldwin County, primarily in the West Beach and Orange Beach areas.  Storm tide flooding also occurred along portions of the Florida coastline from Pensacola Beach to Navarre Beach.   Moderate river flooding occurred in Mobile and Baldwin counties in Alabama, with some river flooding also reported in Escambia, Santa Rosa, and Okaloosa counties of the Florida panhandle.  
Two F0 tornadoes occurred in coastal Okaloosa county in Florida, two F0 tornadoes occurred in coastal Baldwin county of Alabama and one F0 In Mobile county.  Minor structural damage was reported with each tornado, but for the most part, only tree damage occurred.  
Primary storm effects were along the coasts of Alabama and the Florida panhandle.    In Mobile county, the main effects were the tidal flooding that occurred on Dauphin Island.  The berm on the west end of the island was destroyed.  Bayou La Batre and the road leading to Dauphin Island were flooded by above normal tide levels.   Two feet of water covered Water Street in downtown Mobile.  The causeway at the northern end of Mobile Bay was closed for a time due to high water, and some of the businesses on the causeway were flooded.   Some houses along Bayou Sara and the Fowl River  had some water in them.    In Baldwin County, major beach erosion occurred along an area know as West Beach.  Surges in this area were estimated at 5.5 to 6.5 feet.  Wind driven waves on top of this surge deposited sand across West Beach Road and the wave action removed a couple of feet of sand from underneath several beach houses.  Some houses along the Fish River were also flooded.  In Escambia County major beach erosion occurred on Pensacola Beach.  The road to Fort Pickens and the road between Pensacola Beach and Navarre Beach was closed due to the road being overwashed with several feet of sand.

Hurricane "Frances" made landfall along the central Florida coast and, as a weakening system, moved west-northwest across central Florida and then northwestwards into southwest Georgia.  This motion brought the area into the periphery of the storm and north Florida experienced sustained tropical storm force winds with gusts to near hurricane force.  Across the Suwannee Valley heavy rainfall resulted in extensive flooding in many locations.  

The lowest north Florida Mean Sea Level Pressure (MSLP) of 987.8/29.16 in Hg was recorded in Ocala as the center moved to the southwest of the city.  The lowest MSLP readings across north Florida ranged from 987.8/29.16 in HG at Ocala Airport (KOCF) to 1002.7 mb/29.61 in Hg at the National Ocean Systems (NOS) Tide Gage in Fernandina Beach, Florida. 

Maximum sustained winds recorded were 56 knots/64 mph at the St. Augustine CMAN site (SAUF1) at the St. Augustine Pier.  The peak gust was also recorded at SAUF1 with 71 knots/82 mph reported on the evening of the 5th. Generally inland stations (ASOS, AWOS III and mesonet stations) reported sustained winds of 30 to 50 mph with gusts of 40 to 65 mph.  Extensive tree blow down occurred in bands with roof and some structural damage.  Most structural damage was associated with mobile homes and generally weakly constructed permanent structures. Several cases of large trees destroying manufactured homes were observed, especially across Clay, Flagler, Putnam and St. Johns Counties.

Wave heights of 10 to 20 feet were recorded across the coastal waters with tides running one to two feet above astronomical tide levels.  Extensive beach erosion occurred due to long duration of onshore winds due both to "Frances" and a period of onshore flow preceding the event.

Rainfall totals across north Florida generally ranged from 5 to 15 inches.  The heaviest rainfall was associated with a rainband which moved out of Apalachee Bay across north Florida and the Suwannee Valley. This band dropped between 10 and 16 inches of rain from near Ocala through the Suwannee Valley.  Peak Rainfall reports with this band are 15.84 inches in High Springs, Florida; 14.84 at Lake Butler, Florida; and 13.63 inches at Orange Springs, Florida.  Extensive sheet flooding, river flooding and road washouts occurred with this band.  Numerous homes were flooded across the entire region with the Trenton and Lake City areas especially hard hit.  Most rivers in the region were pushed to flood stage with several approaching record flood. Portions of Interstate 10 were closed due to flooding.

Tornadoes occurred across the region with over 20 confirmed touchdowns.  The banded nature of the Tropical Storm wind damage made it very difficult to differentiate between wind damage and tornado damage in subsequent storm damage surveys. No fatalities or injuries occurred due to tornado touchdowns.

Overall extensive tree blow down, power outages and roadways blocked by trees were reported in all areas. In the heavy rainfall areas many dirt and secondary roads were left impassable for up to a week.

Fatalities all occurred in Alachua County, Florida.  09/05/04, 1100 EST a 28 year old male lost control of his vehicle while northbound on Interstate 75 near Micanopy.  The Vehicle hydroplaned and skidded into a wooded area wrapping the vehicle around trees. KGNV observation at 1100 EST, winds 050 degrees 24 mph (21 knots) with gusts to 43 mph (37 knots).  Visibility was 7 miles in light rain. 09/05/04, 1815 EST  A 61 year old woman was killed when a tree toppled onto her mobile home. 4 persons were in the home when the tree fell.  Alachua County Emergency Management received the report at 1819 EST.  KGNV observation at 1909 EST, winds 060 degrees 37 mph (32 knots) with gusts to 47 mph (41 knots). 09/06/04 1825 EST, An 86 year old woman died in a house fire related to the storm.  Due to power outages she was using candles for lighting, fell asleep and the smoldering candles ignited a fire in her home killing her.
09/04/04, 1200 EST, A man and his dog were on board a boat when it capsized in a heavy squall.  The dog was found the following day alive, but the man's body was recovered several days later.","",222

Hurricane "Jeanne" made landfall along the central Florida east coast, very near the location of Hurricane "Frances" some two weeks earlier.  Like "Frances" this system moved west-northwest across central Florida and then northwestwards into southern Georgia.  This motion once again brought the area into the periphery of the storm as north Florida and southeast Georgia experienced sustained tropical storm force winds with gusts to near hurricane force along the coast.  Across the Suwannee Valley and portions of southeast Georgia sustained winds were higher than during "Frances" and rain once again resulted in flooding of many locations.  

The lowest local barometric pressure of 980.0 mb/28.94 in Hg was recorded in Ocala, Florida as the center moved to near the city.  The lowest pressure readings across north Florida ranged from 980.0/28.94 in HG at Ocala Airport (KOCF) to 999.4 mb/29.51 in Hg at the National Ocean Systems (NOS) Tide Gage in Fernandina Beach, Florida.  The lowest pressure readings across southeast Georgia ranged from 993.9 mb/29.35 in Hg at  Douglas airport (KDQH) to 1001.4 mb/29.57 in Hg at Brunswick, Glynnco Airport (KBQK). 

Maximum sustained winds recorded were 48 knots/55 mph at the St. Augustine CMAN site (SAUF1) on the St. Augustine Pier.  The peak gust was also recorded at SAUF1 with 65 knots/75 mph occurring on the 26th. Generally land stations (ASOS, AWOS III and mesonet stations) reported sustained winds of 30 to 50 mph with gusts of 40 to 60 mph.  Tree blow down once again occurred in bands with roof and some structural damage with the most pronounced damage over the Suwannee Valley and southeast Georgia where "Frances" was not quite as severe.  Most structural damage was associated with mobile homes and generally weakly constructed permanent structures. Several cases of large trees destroying manufactured homes were once again observed. One child was killed due to a tree fall.

Wave heights of 20 feet were recorded across the coastal waters with tides running one to two and a half feet above astronomical tide levels on the open ocean.  Tides three to four feet above astronomical occurred on the St. Johns River causing flooding in low lying areas.  Extensive beach erosion once again occurred due to long duration of onshore winds both from "Jeanne" as well as a period of onshore flow preceding the event.

Rainfall totals across north Florida and southeast Georgia generally ranged from 3 to 7 inches.  The heaviest rainfall was once again over the Suwannee Valley and southeast georgia with Live Oak, Florida experiencing 10.88 inches of rain. Due to the already saturated conditions, sheet flooding, river flooding and road washouts again occurred with this event with Live Oak and southeast Georgia hard hit. Most rivers in the region returned to to flood stage and portions of Interstate 10 were again closed due to flooding.

Tornadoes occurred across the coastal region; however, the tornado outbreak was not as extensive as with "Frances."  The banded nature of the Tropical Storm wind damage again made it very difficult to differentiate between wind damage and tornado damage in subsequent storm damage surveys. No fatalities or injuries are believed to have occurred due to tornado touchdowns.

Overall tree blow down, power outages and roadways blocked by trees were reported in most areas. In the heavy rainfall areas many dirt and secondary roads were once again left impassable.","",252

She moved northwest and reached tropical storm strength in the central Bahamas, then turned west and passed through the Straits of Florida between Cuba and the Florida Keys becoming a category one hurricane south of the lower Keys. Rita continued to intensify as it moved into the Gulf of Mexico.

The peak wind gust over the South Florida mainland during Rita was 58 mph measured at Miami Beach, while the peak wind gust over the Atlantic coastal waters was 64 mph at Fowey Rocks Light. Maximum sustained winds were 39 mph at Miami Beach and 58 mph at Fowey Rocks Light. ASOS-measured peak wind gusts include 55 mph at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, 54 mph at Pompano Beach, and 49 mph at Miami International Airport. The minimum barometric pressure measured over the South Florida peninsula was 1008.0 millibar at Miami Beach.

Storm total rain gauge measurements in the metropolitan areas of southeast Florida ranged mostly from one to three inches, with a maximum of 3.28 inches in Perrine.

Tropical Storm Tammy developed off of Cape Canaveral Florida and moved north-northeast toward northeast Florida.  The strongest wind band and rains were located well north and east of the center and dropped a large amount of rainfall across northeast Florida.  This rainfall combined with heavy rainfall and high tides over the previous days, due to strong northeast gradient flow, caused some flooding across the area. In most cases the flooding was confined to urban and small stream flooding and no structures in northeast Florida were threatened.  Peak winds along the coast were 40 knots at the St. Augustine CMAN site (SAUF1) and 40 knots at the St. Augustine Buoy (41012).  Seas were 15.7 feet at the buoy.  tides were 2.5 to 3.25 feet above astronomical prediction on the open coast and 1.75 to 2.5 feet above astronomical on the estuary system and intracoastal waterway.  Tides and high surf caused considerable beach erosion along the Florida coast; however, this has been a long term problem from September onward.  Rainfall in northeast Florida was generally 3 to 6 inches based on WSR 88D rainfall estimates and surface reports.","",334

Tropical Storm Alberto made landfall along the northeast Gulf of Mexico coast and as a weakening system move north-northeast across north Florida and southeast Georgia. This motion positioned the area on the north and east side of the storm. Northeast Florida experienced periods of sustained tropical storm force winds and gusts. Heavy rainfall occurred across the Suwannee River Valley. 

The lowest mean sea level pressure recorded in northeast Florida was 1006.1 mb measured in Gainesville  as the center moved north northwest of the city on June 13th around 11:53Z.  The lowest mean sea level readings across northeast Florida ranged from 1006.1 mb in Gainesville to 1009.4 mb at the NOS tide gauge located at Mayport Naval Station in east Jacksonville. 

Maximum sustained winds recorded were 40 knots/46 mph at Craig Airfield in east Jacksonville on June 13th around 21:11Z. Stations generally reported sustained winds of 20-40 knots (23-46 mph).  The highest wind gust was recorded at Cecil Field in west Jacksonville on June 13th around 19:50Z. Scattered trees and power lines were blown down across the area. Most wind damage occurred from midday June 13th through the evening of June 13th. 

Wave heights reached 6-9 ft across the coastal waters.  The maximum height observed was at the St. Augustine buoy 41012 on June 13th around 1920Z.  Storm tides ran 0.5-1 ft below predicted tide levels at Fernandina Beach (NOS) and Mayport (NOS).  
 
Rainfall totals across northeast Florida ranged from 2 to 6 inches. The heaviest rainfall 5.60 inches was recorded in Hedges, Nassau County. Some minor temporary flooding of flood prone occurred, but the rainfall was beneficial to the area helping it recover from a minor drought period.  River flooding was not a concern. 

Two confirmed tornado touchdowns occurred, one near Jacksonville Beach on June 13th around 08:00Z. Minor damage to a water park was reported. 

No fatalities nor injuries were reported in association with T.S. Alberto.  Minor problems from wind gusts with scattered power outages occurred, as well as minor temporary flooding.","",384

Ernesto moved north-northwest over the Everglades of South Florida during the overnight and morning hours of the 30th, then turned north and northeast over eastern sections of Hendry County during the midday, and passing over western portions of Lake Okeechobee during the early afternoon hours of the 30th. Ernesto is characterized as a minor tropical storm with little overall impact on South Florida, and no direct casualties were noted. There were two indirect deaths in Miami-Dade and Broward counties resulting from vehicle accidents.

Maximum observed sustained winds were 42 knots (48 mph) at the C-MAN station in Fowey Rocks, with a peak gust of 50 knots (58 mph).  Due to the higher than standard anemometer height at Fowey Rocks, a reduction to standard 10-meter elevation yielded a highest sustained wind of 37 knots (43 mph).  Tropical storm force winds were confined to coastal sections along the Atlantic coast, as well as over Lake Okeechobee where South Florida Water Management District platforms LZ40 and L005 recorded maximum sustained winds of 35 and 34 knots (40 and 39 mph) respectively. Platform L005 recorded a peak gust of 51 knots (59 mph). 

The lowest sea-level pressure observed was 1004 mb in Opa-Locka, although estimated lowest pressures on Lake Okeechobee were 1003 mb. Coastal storm tides of around 1 foot above astronomical tide levels were observed on both Atlantic and Gulf coasts, with no beach erosion reported. Rainfall was heaviest over interior sections of South Florida, primarily over the Big Cypress National Preserve of Collier County where 48-hour storm total amounts ranged between 7 and 8 inches. Other rainfall amounts in excess of 5 inches were observed over the rest of interior South Florida including the areas around Lake Okeechobee. These rains caused the Fisheating Creek to overflow its banks at Palmdale in Glades County, and also resulted in some evacuation of homes. Flooding also occurred in portions of Collier County, especially near Golden Gate Estates and Immokalee, with no damage to structures reported.",398
