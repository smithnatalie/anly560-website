Damage from "Earl" was considered minor.  However, cumulative damage estimates, primarily tornadic, from fifteen counties of West Central and Southwest Florida, yielded a value of 1.13 million dollars.

Storm total rainfall amounts were generally under one half inch with a few isolated amounts around three inches.  Beach erosion was generally minor.  However, moderate to severe beach erosion was observed near Venice in Sarasota county.  Street flooding one to two feet deep was reported along the immediate coastal roads of Sarasota, Manatee and Pinellas counties.

Wind damage was minor.  However, Hurricane Earl did spawn six tornadoes, one of which produced F2 damage and two minor injuries.

Although the eye of Hurricane Earl moved onshore near Panama City in the panhandle of Northwest Florida, storm tide was experienced along the entire west coast of Florida.

Hurricane Georges, a Category 2 storm, made landfall near Biloxi, MS early Monday, September 
28, 1998.  A peak wind gust of 52 knots was measured at the Gulf  of Mexico data buoy 85 nautical 
miles south of Panama City.  Georges produced storm surges of 6 to 12 feet along the Florida Panhandle coast and 3 to 5 feet along the Big Bend coast.  Torrential rainfall amounts of 12 to 24 inches were common over Southeast Alabama and the Florida Panhandle with 5 to 10 inches over Southwest Georgia and the Big Bend.  These rains swelled area rivers, creeks, and streams well above flood stage.  
Eight people were injured as numerous tornadoes were spawned by the remnants of Tropical Depression Georges across Southeast Alabama, Southwest Georgia, and Northwest Florida.  Georges pushed 1998 agricultural losses in Georgia over $800 million.  Beach erosion along the Panhandle coast was moderate to severe.  Bay County experienced its worst beach erosion since Hurricane Eloise in 1975.  Liberty, Calhoun, Bay, Holmes, Washington, Gadsden, Walton, Gulf, Franklin, Jackson, Wakulla, Coffee, and Geneva counties were declared federal disaster areas.

As a result of the runoff from Georges' torrential rains, the following area rivers were affected:

Large battering waves undermined piers and walkways along Front Beach Rd in Panama City Beach.  At Carralon Beach, a portion of seawall breached forcing a five-foot wall of water collapsed the first floor of the Pinnacle Port Resort meeting room. Strong winds blew metal awnings off several businesses and storm surge flooding washed out portions of Front Beach and Thomas Rds in Panama City Beach.  Calhoun County officials reported 15 to 20 homes surrounded by high water and severe erosion to numerous unpaved county roads.  Across Coastal and Inland Walton County, storm surges of 10 to 12 feet above tide levels caused extensive beach erosion and undermined numerous coastal structures.  Considerable coastal flooding damaged several homes and businesses.  132 roads were closed including Interstate 10 from Mossy Head to Crestview.  Five people stranded on the Shoal River Bridge near CR 1087 were rescued by boat.  An earthen dam at Kings Lake threatened to breach and 100 residents were evacuated.

Hurricane Georges, a Category 2 storm, made landfall near Biloxi, MS early Monday, September 
28, 1998.  A peak wind gust of 52 knots was measured at the Gulf  of Mexico data buoy 85 nautical 
miles south of Panama City.  Georges produced storm surges of 6 to 12 feet along the Florida Panhandle coast and 3 to 5 feet along the Big Bend coast.  Torrential rainfall amounts of 12 to 24 inches were common over Southeast Alabama and the Florida Panhandle with 5 to 10 inches over Southwest Georgia and the Big Bend.  These rains swelled area rivers, creeks, and streams well above flood stage.  
Eight people were injured as numerous tornadoes were spawned by the remnants of Tropical Depression Georges across Southeast Alabama, Southwest Georgia, and Northwest Florida.  Georges pushed 1998 agricultural losses in Georgia over $800 million.  Beach erosion along the Panhandle coast was moderate to severe.  Bay County experienced its worst beach erosion since Hurricane Eloise in 1975.  Liberty, Calhoun, Bay, Holmes, Washington, Gadsden, Walton, Gulf, Franklin, Jackson, Wakulla, Coffee, and Geneva counties were declared federal disaster areas.

Hurricane Georges, a Category 2 storm, made landfall near Biloxi, MS early Monday, September 
28, 1998.  A peak wind gust of 52 knots was measured at the Gulf  of Mexico data buoy 85 nautical 
miles south of Panama City.  Georges produced storm surges of 6 to 12 feet along the Florida Panhandle coast and 3 to 5 feet along the Big Bend coast.  Torrential rainfall amounts of 12 to 24 inches were common over Southeast Alabama and the Florida Panhandle with 5 to 10 inches over Southwest Georgia and the Big Bend.  These rains swelled area rivers, creeks, and streams well above flood stage.  
Eight people were injured as numerous tornadoes were spawned by the remnants of Tropical Depression Georges across Southeast Alabama, Southwest Georgia, and Northwest Florida.  Georges pushed 1998 agricultural losses in Georgia over $800 million.  Beach erosion along the Panhandle coast was moderate to severe.  Bay County experienced its worst beach erosion since Hurricane Eloise in 1975.  Liberty, Calhoun, Bay, Holmes, Washington, Gadsden, Walton, Gulf, Franklin, Jackson, Wakulla, Coffee, and Geneva counties were declared federal disaster areas.

Hurricane Georges, a Category 2 storm, made landfall near Biloxi, MS early Monday, September 
28, 1998.  A peak wind gust of 52 knots was measured at the Gulf  of Mexico data buoy 85 nautical 
miles south of Panama City.  Georges produced storm surges of 6 to 12 feet along the Florida Panhandle coast and 3 to 5 feet along the Big Bend coast.  Torrential rainfall amounts of 12 to 24 inches were common over Southeast Alabama and the Florida Panhandle with 5 to 10 inches over Southwest Georgia and the Big Bend.  These rains swelled area rivers, creeks, and streams well above flood stage.  
Eight people were injured as numerous tornadoes were spawned by the remnants of Tropical Depression Georges across Southeast Alabama, Southwest Georgia, and Northwest Florida.  Georges pushed 1998 agricultural losses in Georgia over $800 million.  Beach erosion along the Panhandle coast was moderate to severe.  Bay County experienced its worst beach erosion since Hurricane Eloise in 1975.  Liberty, Calhoun, Bay, Holmes, Washington, Gadsden, Walton, Gulf, Franklin, Jackson, Wakulla, Coffee, and Geneva counties were declared federal disaster areas.

Irene moved north across western Cuba on October 14 and strengthened to hurricane intensity early on October 15 in the Straits of Florida.  It then made its first landfall in south Florida in the lower Florida Keys around 9 AM EDT, October 15.  After crossing Florida Bay the center of Irene made landfall on the peninsula near Cape Sable around 4 PM EDT, October 15 as a Category One intensity hurricane.  It moved northeast across central Miami-Dade and Broward counties before exiting into the Atlantic just after midnight EDT on October 16 near Jupiter in northeast Palm Beach County.

Heavy rains and sustained winds of tropical storm force caused widespread flooding and power outages in the metropolitan areas of Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties.  The effects were similar, although somewhat more widespread, than those experienced in tropical storm Gordon in November 1994 and were reminiscent of the wet hurricanes in the 1930s and 1940s.

Rainfall totals in southeast Florida ranged from 6 to 17 inches with many areas getting 10 to 15 inches.  The greatest reliable amount reported was 17.45 inches at Boynton Beach.  The highest sustained wind over land was 60 mph at Miami Beach with many readings from 40 to 55 mph.  Fowey Rocks Light reported sustained winds of 66 mph while the Miami NWS doppler radar estimated areas of sustained hurricane force winds in the Atlantic Ocean just off the southeast Florida coast.  Among the highest recorded gusts were readings of 93 mph near Belle Glade, 85 mph at Homestead Air Reserve Base, 84 mph at Fowey Rocks Light, 74 mph at Turkey Point nuclear power plant and 70 mph at Miami International Airport.  The lowest barometric pressure on the south Florida peninsula was 989.9 mb at Opa Locka Airport.  Storm surge and beach erosion were minimal.

Four tornadoes touched down in Broward and Palm Beach counties, injuring 3 persons.  Several other areas of localized wind damage were reported, especially near the southeast shore of Lake Okeechobee, and were likely attributable to convective downbursts.

There were no direct deaths from Irene, but eight persons died in the aftermath.  Five persons were electrocuted by downed power lines, including three persons from one family.  Three other persons drowned in vehicle-related accidents.  Damage in southeast Florida, mainly from flooding is estimated near $600 million which includes $335 million in agricultural losses.  An estimated 700,000 customers lost electricity.  Flooding in a few residential areas lasted for a week displacing several hundred persons and isolating thousands more.

Gordon's ill-defined center made landfall near the Suwannee River around midnight of the 18th.  Official, maximum sustained winds of 53 mph, with gusts as high as 68 mph, were observed at the C-MAN automated weather sensor at Cedar Key in Levy county prior to landfall near the mouth of the Suwannee River during the late evening of the 17th.

Hurricane Gordon produced maximum storm tides above mean sea level of 2 to 4 feet from Lee north to Manatee county, 4 to 5.5 feet along the Pinellas and Hillsborough county coastlines, and 2 to 4 feet from Pasco north to Levy county on the 17th.

Coastal flooding from storm surge was minimal from Lee county north to the Tampa metropolitan area. Near downtown Tampa, a foot of water covered the south and northern lanes of Bayshore Boulevard during midday on the 17th.  Coastal flood waters between one and two feet covered coastal roads along Longboat Key in Manatee county and Siesta and Casey Keys in Sarasota county.  In Pinellas county, nearly a foot of water covered coastal roads from St. Pete Beach to Clearwater.  The Courtney Campbell Parkway, seperating Pinellas and Hillsborough counties, was closed, due to storm surge flooding, from nearly 5 to 9 pm on the 17th.

Beach erosion was minor from Lee north to Charlotte, moderate to severe along Sarasota and Manatee counties, minor to moderate over Manatee, Pinellas, Pasco and Hernando counties.  At Bradenton Beach in Manatee county, nearly 100 feet of pristine beach, five to six feet in depth, was stripped away by wave action from Hurricane Gordon.  In Sarasota county, storm surge and wave action from Gordon caused nearly 1.1 million dollars in beach erosion while in Manatee county, beach erosion was estimated at 500 thousand dollars.

Inland flooding from rainfall occurred over low-lying and urban areas in mainly Lee, Charlotte, Sarasota, Manatee, Hardee, DeSoto, Highlands and southern Polk counties (see flood entries).

Eastern rain bands of Hurricane Gordon spawned at least five known tornadoes, two F1's and three F0's over Central and Southwest Florida (see tornado entries).

Damage in Levy county was confined to roofs and toppled trees, mainly in the Cedar Key area, where a total of $100,000 dollars was estimated.

Damage in Citrus county was confined to a few downed trees, power lines and snapped branches from Sulphur Springs south to Ozello mounting to less than $25,000 dollars.

Damage in Hernando county was confined to ten homes that suffered floodwater damage along the coast along with a few toppled trees and downed power lines.  Damage in Hernando county was estimated at $100,000 dollars.

Damage in Pasco county was confined to 15 roof damaged villas, downed trees and damaged vehicles in the New Port Colony Villas subdivsion in New Port Richey estimated at $250,000 dollars.

In Pinellas county, 51 single-family homes, 32 mobile homes, 27 multi-family homes and 24 businesses sustained minor wind or water damage.  Estimated cost of the damage in Pinellas county was nearly $500,000 dollars.

A sailboat broke loose from moorings around 0730 EST on August 13, striking a phase of a 115 kilovolt transmission line serving the lower Keys, causing a widespread power outage west of Marathon through Key West.

Maximum storm surge was estimated to near 6 feet at Dry Tortugas/Garden Key by National Park Service personnel, who rode out the hurricane at the fort.  Wave action produced extensive flooding of the park grounds outside of the Fort Jefferson walls.  Approximately 1000 feet of brickwork was lost on the outer moat wall, which was completely submerged at the time of high tide.  Numerous finger docks and the deck of the main dock were destroyed.  Scaffolding used during the Fort's multi-year renovation project was also damaged and found floating in the moat.  The Dry Tortugas C-MAN station, which included instrumentation less than 15 feet above mean sea level, was also destroyed, likely from the combination of wave action and elevated tide levels.

Hurricane Charley, a powerful but compact Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, roared into Southwest Florida during the late afternoon of August 13th, then raced northeast through the central Florida peninsula, reaching the Atlantic Coast as a Category 1 hurricane near Daytona Beach in only seven hours.  In all, 1.42 million people evacuated their homes in southwest and west central Florida because the forecasted path was parallel to the coast and Charley could have made land fall anywhere from Tampa to Fort Myers. 

Hurricane Charley made landfall just north of Captiva with sustained winds estimated at 145 mph.  The winds damaged or destroyed thousands of homes, knocked down tens of thousands of trees, and took out power to more than 2 million Floridians.  The most intense damage occurred in a band approximately 10 miles wide centered on the path of the eyewall.  Additional damage was seen in a band approximately 35 miles wide centered on the path of the eyewall.  Rainfall was limited to 3 to 5 inches in a 20 mile radius surrounding the center, and the areal extent of storm surge was limited by the lack of buildup of high seas as the storm raced northward.

By 530 PM EDT, the center was 5 miles west of Arcadia (Desoto County); at 630 PM EDT, 1 mile west of Wauchula (Hardee County), and at 730 PM EDT, 4 miles west of Lake Wales (Polk County). At approximately 830 PM EDT, Charley had exited West Central Florida, and in 45 minutes slammed into Orlando International Airport.

Charlotte County took the brunt of the destruction caused by Hurricane Charley.  The airport in Punta Gorda recorded sustained winds of 87 mph with gusts to 112 mph before the wind equipment blew apart.  Most of the buildings and airplanes at the airport were destroyed.  An unofficial wind gust of 173 mph was reported from a tower on the Charlotte Regional Medial Center in Punta Gorda.  Saint Joseph's Hospital in Port Charlotte lost its roof.  No storm surge was reported but Charlotte Harbor reported a four foot drop in the water level.  There were four direct fatalities that were a result of blunt force trauma from flying debris.  The estimated 700 injuries were a result of additional trauma caused to the 450 patients that were evacuated from damaged hospitals.  An estimated 250 people were treated by three different remote medical teams dispatched throughout the county.

The storm surge was estimated at 4 to 6 feet at Fort Myers Beach, Horseshoe Key, and Port Boca Grand.  Two direct and two indirect deaths were blamed on this hurricane. Sustained winds of 61 mph with gusts to 78 mph were recorded at the Fort Myers Regional Southwest airport. A personal weather station in Fort Myers recorded a wind gust of 95 mph.  The winds damaged or destroyed 41% of the homes in Cape Coral, ripped the roof off of the post office in Fort Myers, and lead to 1.9 millions cubic yards of debris in Lee County.

The fast movement of Hurricane Charley limited rain fall totals to 4 to 6 inches along the track of the hurricane's eye wall. River flooding of one to three feet above flood stage was found on area rivers south of Interstate 4.  

Hurricane Charley, a powerful but compact Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, roared into Southwest Florida during the late afternoon of August 13th, then raced northeast through the central Florida peninsula, reaching the Atlantic Coast as a Category 1 hurricane near Daytona Beach in only seven hours.  In all, 1.42 million people evacuated their homes in southwest and west central Florida because the forecasted path was parallel to the coast and Charley could have made land fall anywhere from Tampa to Fort Myers. 

Hurricane Charley made landfall just north of Captiva with sustained winds estimated at 145 mph.  The winds damaged or destroyed thousands of homes, knocked down tens of thousands of trees, and took out power to more than 2 million Floridians.  The most intense damage occurred in a band approximately 10 miles wide centered on the path of the eyewall.  Additional damage was seen in a band approximately 35 miles wide centered on the path of the eyewall.  Rainfall was limited to 3 to 5 inches in a 20 mile radius surrounding the center, and the areal extent of storm surge was limited by the lack of buildup of high seas as the storm raced northward. 

The center of Charley crossed the barrier islands of Cayo Costa and Gasparilla Island at 345 PM EDT, then moved up Charlotte Harbor before making landfall at Mangrove Point, just southwest of Punta Gorda, at 435 PM EDT.  By 530 PM EDT, the center was 5 miles west of Arcadia (Desoto County); at 630 PM EDT, 1 mile west of Wauchula (Hardee County), and at 730 PM EDT, 4 miles west of Lake Wales (Polk County). At approximately 830 PM EDT, Charley had exited West Central Florida, and in 45 minutes slammed into Orlando International Airport.

Charlotte County took the brunt of the destruction caused by Hurricane Charley.  The airport in Punta Gorda recorded sustained winds of 87 mph with gusts to 112 mph before the wind equipment blew apart.  Most of the buildings and airplanes at the airport were destroyed.  An unofficial wind gust of 173 mph was reported from a tower on the Charlotte Regional Medial Center in Punta Gorda.  Saint Joseph's Hospital in Port Charlotte lost its roof.  No storm surge was reported but Charlotte Harbor reported a four foot drop in the water level.  There were four direct fatalities that were a result of blunt force trauma from flying debris.  The estimated 700 injuries were a result of additional trauma caused to the 450 patients that were evacuated from damaged hospitals.

Like the counties to the south, Volusia County experienced widespread power outages, thousands of trees down, and damage to roofs, mobile homes, porches, awnings and car ports.  The Ormond Beach area was hit especially hard with east winds off the Atlantic as the hurricane center moved off the coast just to the south near Daytona Beach. Hundreds of trees were blown down and roofs were severely damaged on three beachfront hotels. Because the duration of the onshore wind was so brief, there was negligible storm surge. Minor roadway flooding occurred from the two to four inches of rain that fell.  A strong F1 touched down in South Daytona Beach with the primary rainband ahead of the hurricane. This tornado destroyed a home and severly damaged three others, mainly from fallen trees.  The roof was blown off a strip mall store and a fire was started at a service station when the tornado destroyed the gas pumps and blew down the service island canopy.  A smaller F0 tornado also came ashore on the barrier island injuring an elderly woman and damaging the roof of her house.  Two fatalities were attributed to Hurricane Charley.

Frances then moved generally west northwest and weakened to a Category 2 hurricane while crossing the northwest Bahamas.  After stalling for about 12 hours on September 4 in the Florida Straits between Grand Bahama Island and the southeast Florida coast, the center of the nearly 70-mile diameter eye crossed the Florida coast near Sewalls Point, at 1 A.M. EDT, September 5, 2004 with the southern eyewall affecting the extreme northeast portion of Palm Beach County.  Frances moved farther inland just north of Lake Okeechobee and weakened to a tropical storm before crossing the entire Florida Peninsula and exiting into the Gulf of Mexico just north of Tampa late on September 5.

Frances was moving to the west northwest at 7 mph and maintained hurricane strength as it crossed the east half of the Florida Peninsula. Frances was downgraded to a tropical storm in the afternoon on the 5th when it was about 50 miles east of Tampa Bay.  

In Martin, St. Lucie and Indian River counties, the slow moving storm produced wind gusts to hurricane strength for about 19 hours, producing an estimated 4.5 billion dollars in damage. Wind gusts well over 100 mph destroyed coastal structures, marinas, and vessels.  Farther inland, hundreds of homes, mobile homes, and businesses were destroyed, and thousands were damaged.  Highest recorded winds for Martin county were 91 knots (105 mph) at Port St. Lucie Inlet. The highest wind gust in St. Lucie County, was 94 knots (108 mph) at Ft. Pierce and in Indian River County, 70 knots ( 81 mph) in Vero Beach. 

Brevard and Volusia counties also recorded hours of hurricane force wind gusts from the north side of the storm. Thousands of homes and businesses were destroyed and damaged, with hundreds of thousands of residences with out power. Brevard was hit with an estimated damage of 90 million dollars. Damage in Volusia County was close to 240 million dollars. Most official NWS surface wind equipment failed prior to the max wind of the storm when power was knocked out.  Highest recorded surface winds gust was 78 knots (90 mph) from Merritt Island Airport, although a wind tower at NASA report gusts to 82 knots (94 mph).  These winds were likely representative of what most of the beach front areas were hit with. Daytona Beach International Airport recorded a wind gust to 65 knots (75 mph) prior to the power outage.  

Lowest recorded pressures for Hurricane Frances were, 994.9 mb at Daytona Beach Airport, 995.9 mb at NWS Melbourne, 962.1 at St. Lucie Lock, and 964.7 at Port Mayaca Lock.  

Beach errosion was moderate to severe from Cocoa Beach to Ft. Pierce, ranging from 5 to 6 feet from south Brevard County to up to 12 feet near Vero Beach where a large section of a beach road was washed out.  A storm surge of 5.89 feet MSL was recorded at the St. Lucie Lock. A surge near 6 feet occured near Cocoa Beach ranging to near 8 feet around Vero Beach where onshore winds were the strongest. 

Radar estimates show as much as 13 inches of rain fell in Volusia County with a range of 6 to 10 inches of rain in the remaining counties.

Frances was moving to the west northwest at 7 mph and maintained hurricane strength as it crossed the east half of the Florida Peninsula. Frances was downgraded to a tropical storm in the afternoon on the 5th when it was about 50 miles east of Tampa Bay.  

In Martin, St. Lucie and Indian River counties, the slow moving storm produced wind gusts to hurricane strength for about 19 hours, producing an estimated 4.5 billion dollars in damage. Wind gusts well over 100 mph destroyed coastal structures, marinas, and vessels.  Farther inland, hundreds of homes, mobile homes, and businesses were destroyed, and thousands were damaged.  Highest recorded winds for Martin county were 91 knots (105 mph) at Port St. Lucie Inlet. The highest wind gust in St. Lucie County, was 94 knots (108 mph) at Ft. Pierce and in Indian River County, 70 knots ( 81 mph) in Vero Beach. 

Brevard and Volusia counties also recorded hours of hurricane force wind gusts from the north side of the storm. Thousands of homes and businesses were destroyed and damaged, with hundreds of thousands of residences with out power. Brevard was hit with an estimated damage of 90 million dollars. Damage in Volusia County was close to 240 million dollars. Most official NWS surface wind equipment failed prior to the max wind of the storm when power was knocked out.  Highest recorded surface winds gust was 78 knots (90 mph) from Merritt Island Airport, although a wind tower at NASA report gusts to 82 knots (94 mph).  These winds were likely representative of what most of the beach front areas were hit with. Daytona Beach International Airport recorded a wind gust to 65 knots (75 mph) prior to the power outage.  

Lowest recorded pressures for Hurricane Frances were, 994.9 mb at Daytona Beach Airport, 995.9 mb at NWS Melbourne, 962.1 at St. Lucie Lock, and 964.7 at Port Mayaca Lock.  

Beach errosion was moderate to severe from Cocoa Beach to Ft. Pierce, ranging from 5 to 6 feet from south Brevard County to up to 12 feet near Vero Beach where a large section of a beach road was washed out.  A storm surge of 5.89 feet MSL was recorded at the St. Lucie Lock. A surge near 6 feet occured near Cocoa Beach ranging to near 8 feet around Vero Beach where onshore winds were the strongest. 

Radar estimates show as much as 13 inches of rain fell in Volusia County with a range of 6 to 10 inches of rain in the remaining counties.

Remarkably, this is in the same location where Hurricane Frances came ashore on September 5th. Jeanne was moving to the west northwest at 12 mph and maintained hurricane strength as it crossed most of the Florida Peninsula. Jeanne was downgraded to a tropical storm in the afternoon of September 26th when it was about 40 miles northeast of Tampa Bay. 

In Volusia County, hurricane force wind gusts began with the rain bands on the north side of Jeanne as they moved on shore. The county, already battered by Hurricane Frances suffered extensive additional damage. Fresh water flooding from local heavy rain, and Flooding of the St. Johns River affected more than 200 residences and business properties. Total damage estimates were near $60 million.  Hurricane winds damaged or destroyed thousands of  homes and businesses. Hundreds of thousands of residences were with out power.  Most official NWS surface wind equipment failed prior to the max wind of the storm when power was knocked out. The highest recorded wind was only 55 knots (63 mph), but wind damage suggest numerous gusts in excess of hurricane strength.  The lowest recorded pressure was 993.6 mb.     

In Brevard County, the strongest winds swept across the coast south of Cape Canaveral and the southern coastal communities. Grant, Micco and the south part of Palm Bay were hit much harder than the northern locations. County wide damages were reported at $320 million. Especially hard hit was the mobile home community of Barefoot Bay. A Palm Bay man drowned when his pickup truck ran off a road into a deep flooded ditch. Highest wind gusts in the county were, 79 knots (91 mph) at the NWS Melbourne office. Based on radar information, it is estimated that wind gusts over 100 kts (115 mph) swept across the southern coastal areas. The lowest recorded pressure for the storm was 986.8 mb at Melbourne. Total damage estimates for the county were near $320 million. 

Indian River County was hit hard by Jeanne being to the right of the land falling eye. 8,300 residences were damaged or destroyed and over 41,000 residences were damaged. Total wind damage for the county was over $2 billion. Highest wind gusts in the county were, 106 knots (122 mph) at Vero Beach and 101 knots (116 mph) at Sebastian.  The lowest recorded pressure for the county was 965.5 mb at Vero Beach. 

The north part of the hurricane eye passed over St. Lucie County producing $1.2 billion in wind damage. The marinas along Ft. Pierce inlet were hit destroying dozens of boats.  A 34 year old man was electrocuted when his truck ran into a power line.  Thousands of homes and business were damaged and destroyed by the wind. Especially hard hit were the dozens of mobile home communities. Highest wind gusts in the county were, 111 knots (128 mph) from a private residence just north of Ft. Pierce inlet. The lowest recorded pressure for the county was 952.9 mb at Ft. Pierce. 

The eye of Hurricane Jeanne passed over the community of Sewell' Point in Martin County. Over 180 residences were destroyed with about 4000 residences either damaged or destroyed.  The highest wind speed recorded was 91 kts (105 mph) in Jensen Beach.  No pressure data was recorded for Martin County. Severe beach erosion occurred compounding the damage from Hurricane Frances just 3 weeks earlier.",219

She moved across Puerto Rico and Hispaniola then turned north into the Atlantic and became a hurricane on September 20.  Jeanne made a clockwise loop for three days in the Atlantic north of Hispaniola before moving west northwest. It strengthened to a Category 3 Hurricane while over the northwest Bahamas and then make landfall around 11 P.M., September 25 near the south end of Hutchinson Island, nearly coincident with the landfall point of Hurricane Frances nearly three week before.  The 40-mile diameter eye was not quite as large as Frances, but the southern eyewall again affected northeast Palm Beach County.  After landfall Jeanne initially moved along a track similar to Frances, just north of Lake Okeechobee as it weakened to a tropical storm then it turned to the northwest and moved over the northwest Florida Peninsula.

Although slightly smaller and stronger then Hurricane Frances, winds and pressures  over southeast Florida were remarkably similar to Frances.  Unfortunately, the ASOS at West Palm Beach International Airport quit sending data during the height of the hurricane. Sustained tropical storm-force winds likely occurred over most of Palm Beach and northeast Glades counties and portions of Broward, Hendry and Collier counties.  Although no sustained hurricane-force winds were officially observed in any of the six south Florida counties, portions of northern Palm Beach County mostly likely experienced them.  A South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) instrument in the Martin County portion of Lake Okeechobee measured a 15-minute sustained wind of 79 mph with a peak gust of 105 mph.  In metropolitan Palm Beach the highest official sustained wind speed was 60 mph with a peak gust of 94 mph from the C-MAN station at Lake Worth Pier. An unofficial peak wind gust of 125 mph was measured in West Palm Beach at the Solid Waste Treatment Plant.   In Glades County near the western shore of Lake Okeechobee the highest sustained wind measured at a SFWMD instrument was 68 mph with a peak gust of 94 mph. Near Clewiston the highest measured sustained wind was 31 mph with a peak wind gust of 72 mph from a SFWMD instrument.  The highest measured sustained wind in Broward County was 46 mph with a peak wind gust of 67 mph from the ASOS site at Pompano Beach Airpark.  At Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport the ASOS site measured a maximum sustained wind of 40 mph with a peak gust of 56 mph.  In Miami-Dade County a maximum sustained wind of 49 mph with a peak gust of 59 mph was measured at the C-MAN station at Fowey Rocks Light with sustained winds of 26 mph and gusts to 36 mph at Miami International Airport ASOS.  At the Naples Municipal Airport, the ASOS maximum sustained wind was measured at 33 mph with a peak gust of 45 mph.  The lowest barometric pressure of 960.4 mb was measured at a SFWMD site in the Martin County portion of Lake Okeechobee.

A SFWMD gage measured a maximum storm-total rainfall amount of 10.22 inches over the eastern portion of Lake Okeechobee.  A SFWMD gage about four miles west of West Palm Beach International Airport measured 9.10 inches with 8.79 inches of that occurring in a 24-hour period. At Moore Haven, 5.99 inches of rain was measured.  Widespread storm-total amounts of one to four inches occurred in most of southeast and interior south Florida with Miami-Dade County and Collier County averaging one half to one inch. Mostly minor rainfall flooding was observed except locally severe in Palm Beach Gardens, Jupiter and in the farmlands of western Palm Beach County.

The estimated maximum storm surge ranged from two to four feet along the northeast Palm Beach Coast to one to two feet along the northeast Broward Coast.  Within the confines of the Herbert Hoover Dike, water levels on Lake Okeechobee fluctuated up to seven feet above and below normal causing severe flooding of some marinas.  Beach erosion was moderate in Palm Beach and minor in Broward and Miami-Dade counties.

There were no confirmed tornadoes.

There were no known direct deaths but four persons died in the aftermath.  An unknown number of injuries occurred. 

Property damage from storm surge and winds at the coast occurred to condos, marinas, piers, seawalls, bridges and docks, as well as to boats and a few coastal roadways. Inland wind damage to building roofs, mobile homes, trees, power lines, signs, and outbuildings occurred over mainly over Palm Beach County and portions of eastern Glades and Hendry counties.

A preliminary damage estimate for Jeanne in southeast Florida is $330 million, including $260 million in Palm Beach, $50 million in Broward and $10 million in Miami-Dade.  Agricultural  Damage in Palm Beach County was estimated at $30 million.

Mostly minor rainfall flooding was observed except locally severe in Palm Beach Gardens, Jupiter and in the farmlands of western Palm Beach County.

The estimated maximum storm surge ranged from two to four feet along the northeast Palm Beach Coast to one to two feet along the northeast Broward Coast.  Within the confines of the Herbert Hoover Dike, water levels on Lake Okeechobee fluctuated up to seven feet above and below normal causing severe flooding of some marinas.  Beach erosion was moderate in Palm Beach and minor in Broward and Miami-Dade counties.

There were no confirmed tornadoes.

There were no known direct deaths but four persons died in the aftermath.  An unknown number of injuries occurred. 

Property damage from storm surge and winds at the coast occurred to condos, marinas, piers, seawalls, bridges and docks, as well as to boats and a few coastal roadways. Inland wind damage to building roofs, mobile homes, trees, power lines, signs, and outbuildings occurred over mainly over Palm Beach County and portions of eastern Glades and Hendry counties.

A preliminary damage estimate for Jeanne in southeast Florida is $330 million, including $260 million in Palm Beach, $50 million in Broward and $10 million in Miami-Dade.  Agricultural  Damage in Palm Beach County was estimated at $30 million.

She moved across Puerto Rico and Hispaniola then turned north into the Atlantic and became a hurricane on September 20.  Jeanne made a clockwise loop for three days in the Atlantic north of Hispaniola before moving west northwest. It strengthened to a Category 3 Hurricane while over the northwest Bahamas and then make landfall around 11 P.M., September 25 near the south end of Hutchinson Island, nearly coincident with the landfall point of Hurricane Frances nearly three week before.  The 40-mile diameter eye was not quite as large as Frances, but the southern eyewall again affected northeast Palm Beach County.  After landfall Jeanne initially moved along a track similar to Frances, just north of Lake Okeechobee as it weakened to a tropical storm then it turned to the northwest and moved over the northwest Florida Peninsula.

Although slightly smaller and stronger then Hurricane Frances, winds and pressures  over southeast Florida were remarkably similar to Frances.  Unfortunately, the ASOS at West Palm Beach International Airport quit sending data during the height of the hurricane. Sustained tropical storm-force winds likely occurred over most of Palm Beach and northeast Glades counties and portions of Broward, Hendry and Collier counties.  Although no sustained hurricane-force winds were officially observed in any of the six south Florida counties, portions of northern Palm Beach County mostly likely experienced them.  A South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) instrument in the Martin County portion of Lake Okeechobee measured a 15-minute sustained wind of 79 mph with a peak gust of 105 mph.  In metropolitan Palm Beach the highest official sustained wind speed was 60 mph with a peak gust of 94 mph from the C-MAN station at Lake Worth Pier. An unofficial peak wind gust of 125 mph was measured in West Palm Beach at the Solid Waste Treatment Plant.   In Glades County near the western shore of Lake Okeechobee the highest sustained wind measured at a SFWMD instrument was 68 mph with a peak gust of 94 mph. Near Clewiston the highest measured sustained wind was 31 mph with a peak wind gust of 72 mph from a SFWMD instrument.  The highest measured sustained wind in Broward County was 46 mph with a peak wind gust of 67 mph from the ASOS site at Pompano Beach Airpark.  At Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport the ASOS site measured a maximum sustained wind of 40 mph with a peak gust of 56 mph.  In Miami-Dade County a maximum sustained wind of 49 mph with a peak gust of 59 mph was measured at the C-MAN station at Fowey Rocks Light with sustained winds of 26 mph and gusts to 36 mph at Miami International Airport ASOS.  At the Naples Municipal Airport, the ASOS maximum sustained wind was measured at 33 mph with a peak gust of 45 mph.  The lowest barometric pressure of 960.4 mb was measured at a SFWMD site in the Martin County portion of Lake Okeechobee.

A SFWMD gage measured a maximum storm-total rainfall amount of 10.22 inches over the eastern portion of Lake Okeechobee.  A SFWMD gage about four miles west of West Palm Beach International Airport measured 9.10 inches with 8.79 inches of that occurring in a 24-hour period. At Moore Haven, 5.99 inches of rain was measured.  Widespread storm-total amounts of one to four inches occurred in most of southeast and interior south Florida with Miami-Dade County and Collier County averaging one half to one inch.

Major Hurricane Dennis impacted portions of the area during the day and evening of July 10th.    The storm made landfall around 130 PM CST as a category three hurricane near Navarre Beach in Santa Rosa county.  Dennis then moved north northwest across Santa Rosa and northeast Escambia county in Florida.  The weakening storm then moved across the west part of Escambia, the south part of Monroe, the east part of Clarke and the northeast part of Choctaw counties in Alabama.  Dennis had a very small eye and winds around the eyewall of the storm caused significant damage as the storm moved north.  An aerial survey of the damage showed a five to ten mile wide area of destruction, with most of the damage east of the eye of the storm.  As Dennis moved north into Alabama the damage diminished and was confined to a smaller area.  A lot of the damage looked like a giant tornado, except the trees were all facing in the same general direction. Coastal counties across the area from Mobile to Destin were put under a Hurricane Watch at 300 PM CST on July 8, then a Hurricane Warning at 300 AM CST on July 9.  An Inland Hurricane Warning was issued for most of the inland counties in Alabama at 436 PM CST on July 9.  Parts of southeast Mississippi were added to the warning during the early morning hours of July 10.  Most of the warnings were dropped at 900 PM CST on July 10 as Dennis weakened as it moved inland.
Some of the wind reports from across northwest Florida on July 10 were as follows: Pensacola Regional Airport,  sustained wind of 66 knots with peak gust of 81 knots.  Pensacola Naval Air Station, sustained wind of 39 knots, peak gust 50 knots.  Pensacola (WEAR-TV), peak gust 46 knots. Valpariaso (Eglin Air Force Base), sustained winds of 48 knots, peak gust of 72 knots.  Destin airport, sustained winds of  49 knots, peak gust 64 knots.  Crestview, sustained wind of 37 knots, peak gust 50 knots.  Navarre, peak gust of 105 knots.  Pensacola (near airport), peak gust 83 knots.  Destin (near airport), peak gust 70 knots. Pace, peak gust 92 knots.  Pensacola (southeast of airport), peak gust 88 knots.  Some of the wind reports across southwest Alabama on July 10 were as follows:  Mobile Regional Airport, sustained wind of 32 knots, peak gust of 42 knots.  Dauphin Island, sustained wind at 42 knots, gust to 57 knots.    Mobile Bay (USS Alabama), peak gust 67 knots.  
Some of the lowest sea level pressures recorded with Dennis on July 10 were as follows: Pensacola Regional Airport, 956.6 MB.  Valpariaso (Eglin Air Force Base), 986.1 MB.  Pensacola Naval Air Station, 976.6 MB.  Mobile Bay (USS Alabama), 987.8 MB.  Mobile Regional Airport, 990.5 MB.    
The highest 48 hour rainfall totals associated with Hurricane Dennis: In Florida:  Pensacola (WEAR) 7.67 inches.  Pace, 6.90 inches.  Milton, 7.01 inches.  Munson, 6.93 inches.  Niceville, 5.15 inches.  In Alabama: Bay Minette, 4.65 inches.   Butler 4.36 inches.
The highest storm tides from Dennis occurred at: Pensacola with 5.50 feet.  Santa Rosa Sound with 5.00 feet.  Destin with 4.60 feet.  Perdido Pass with 4.10 feet.  Pace with 3.5 feet.  A storm survey measured 6-6.5 feet on Navarre Beach.  Since the eye of Dennis was very small, the highest surge values were near and just to the right of the eye of the storm.  Some higher surge values occurred well east of Destin before Dennis moved ashore.
Major beach erosion occurred from Pensacola Beach to east of Destin.  Minor beach erosion occurred from Dauphin Island to Orange Beach.  Major flash flooding occurred along and east of the center of Dennis during the afternoon and evening of July 10 across northwest Florida and southwest Alabama.    As Dennis moved inland,  tornado like damage occurred near the eyewall of storm.  Almost every structure located on Navarre Beach suffered some kind of damage.  The structures that were located on the beach front all suffered damage.   The Air Force bases at Eglin and Hurlburt reported over a half billion dollars in damage from Dennis.  Almost 200 homes in northwest Florida reported major damage.  Part of U. S. Highway 98 between Fort Walton Beach and Destin in Okaloosa county were again washed out by high water.  The west bound lanes were damaged by the surge but the east bound lanes were okay.  It was also estimated that most of this years cotton crop in northwest Florida was damaged.
No direct deaths were reported with Dennis, but three indirect deaths were reported.  Two died from Carbon Monoxide poisoning in Escambia county Florida and one from electrocution in Escambia county Alabama.  All of the deaths were related to the improper use of emergency generators.",237

Some of the lowest sea level pressures recorded with Dennis on July 10 were as follows: Pensacola Regional Airport, 956.6 MB.  Valpariaso (Eglin Air Force Base), 986.1 MB.  Pensacola Naval Air Station, 976.6 MB.  Mobile Bay (USS Alabama), 987.8 MB.  Mobile Regional Airport, 990.5 MB.    
The highest 48 hour rainfall totals associated with Hurricane Dennis: In Florida:  Pensacola (WEAR) 7.67 inches.  Pace, 6.90 inches.  Milton, 7.01 inches.  Munson, 6.93 inches.  Niceville, 5.15 inches.  In Alabama: Bay Minette, 4.65 inches.   Butler 4.36 inches.
The highest storm tides from Dennis occurred at: Pensacola with 5.50 feet.  Santa Rosa Sound with 5.00 feet.  Destin with 4.60 feet.  Perdido Pass with 4.10 feet.  Pace with 3.5 feet.  A storm survey measured 6-6.5 feet on Navarre Beach.  Since the eye of Dennis was very small, the highest surge values were near and just to the right of the eye of the storm.  Some higher surge values occurred well east of Destin before Dennis moved ashore.
Major beach erosion occurred from Pensacola Beach to east of Destin.  Minor beach erosion occurred from Dauphin Island to Orange Beach.  Major flash flooding occurred along and east of the center of Dennis during the afternoon and evening of July 10 across northwest Florida and southwest Alabama.    As Dennis moved inland,  tornado like damage occurred near the eyewall of storm.  Almost every structure located on Navarre Beach suffered some kind of damage.  The structures that were located on the beach front all suffered damage.   The Air Force bases at Eglin and Hurlburt reported over a half billion dollars in damage from Dennis.  Almost 200 homes in northwest Florida reported major damage.  Part of U. S. Highway 98 between Fort Walton Beach and Destin in Okaloosa county were again washed out by high water.  The west bound lanes were damaged by the surge but the east bound lanes were okay.  It was also estimated that most of this years cotton crop in northwest Florida was damaged.
No direct deaths were reported with Dennis, but three indirect deaths were reported.  Two died from Carbon Monoxide poisoning in Escambia county Florida and one from electrocution in Escambia county Alabama.  All of the deaths were related to the improper use of emergency generators.",242

The tropical wave became a tropical depression near the central Bahamas late on August 22.  The depression moved slowly northwest and became tropical storm Katrina on August 24 near the northwest Bahama Islands then turned west and intensified to a hurricane on August 25, a few hours before making landfall on the southeast Florida Coast.

The center of the ragged 25-mile-wide eye of Katrina made landfall around 6:30 PM EDT, Thursday, August 25 near the Broward/Miami-Dade County border then moved toward the southwest across central and southwest Miami-Dade County, passing directly over the National Weather Service (NWS) Office in Sweetwater.  Katrina briefly weakened to a tropical storm before exiting the Florida peninsula into the Gulf of Mexico early on August 26 just north of Cape Sable in mainland Monroe County then quickly regained hurricane strength in the southeast Gulf of Mexico.  The distribution of winds and rain near the center of Katrina while passing across the south Florida peninsula were asymmetrical with the strongest winds and heaviest rain located to the south and east of the center.

Measurements from reconnaissance aircraft and Miami Doppler Weather Radar estimated maximum sustained winds in Katrina to be 80 mph.  The maximum reported sustained surface wind over the south Florida peninsula was 72 mph measured atop a building at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science (RSMAS) on Virginia Key.  This wind value was determined by adjusting the actual wind speed to the standard anemometer height of 10 meters.  This same site recorded an unadjusted peak wind speed of 94 mph.  The anemometer atop the Miami Weather Forecast Office in Sweetwater measured a sustained wind of 69 mph.  Maximum sustained winds measured at the NWS Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) sites included 60 mph at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, 50 mph at Tamiami Airport in West Kendall and 48 mph at Miami International Airport.

The maximum ASOS-measured peak wind gusts included 82 mph at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, 78 mph at Miami International Airport and 76 mph at Tamiami Airport in West Kendall.  Other unofficial peak wind gust measurements included 97 mph at Homestead General Airport, 92 mph at Port Everglades, 87 mph at the Miami Weather Forecast Office in Sweetwater, 77 mph at Marco Island, 76 mph at the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) on Virginia Key, and 64 mph at Boca Raton Airport.  The minimum pressure measured over the south Florida peninsula was 983.1 millibars at the NWS site in Sweetwater.

Rainfall amounts were excessive across portions of south Miami-Dade County causing flooding of structures, vehicles, crop lands and nurseries.  A maximum storm total amount of 16.33 inches, of which 15.10 inches fell in a 24-hour period, was measured by a cooperative observed in Perrine.  Other heavy storm total amounts in south Miami-Dade County included 14.04 inches at Homestead Air Reserve Base, 12.25 inches near Florida City and 11.13 inches near Cutler Ridge.  Most of the remainder of metropolitan Miami-Dade County and all of metropolitan Broward and Palm Beach counties generally received rain amounts of two to four inches.  Rainfall over interior south Florida ranged from one to three inches with mostly less than one inch over coastal Collier County.

Mostly minor beach erosion and isolated incidence of coastal flooding were observed.  The maximum storm tide was estimated at three to five feet along the southwest Florida coast in mainland Monroe County.  This caused water damage to several homes, trailers and vehicles at Flamingo in Everglades National Park early on August 26.  Other maximum storm tide values included 3.0 feet at Naples Pier along the southwest coast at 2.1 feet at Virginia Key on the southeast coast.

A total of six persons are known to have died directly as a result of the winds and water.  Three of the deaths, all in Broward County, were associated with trees or tree limbs that were blown down, striking people.  The other three deaths, all in Miami-Dade County, were associated with drownings, two on boats and one under unknown circumstances.  In addition at least another six people died from indirect hurricane effects including three from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by generators, one in a vehicle accident, one during debris cleanup and one associated with a lack of electricity.  Several people were injured, including five or six related to carbon monoxide poisoning.

Total damage in south Florida was estimated at around $100 million.  Between 100 and 200 houses suffered significant damage, mainly in south Miami-Dade due to flooding.

Wilma developed from a tropical depression near Jamaica, a typical source region for October tropical cyclones, on the afternoon of October 15, 2005. It became the 21st named storm of the season during the morning hours of October 17, 2005, which tied the record for the most named storms in one season originally set back in 1933. Wilma underwent a rapid intensification cycle which began on October 18th and ended in the early morning hours of October 19th, with a central pressure decrease of an incredible 88 mb in only 12 hours!  The central pressure reached 882 mb, making Wilma the most intense hurricane ever in the Atlantic Basin, a full 6 mb lower than Hurricane Gilbert in September 1988. Wilma went on to make landfall on Cozumel Island just off the Yucatan Peninsula as a strong category 4 hurricane on Friday, October 21st, then drifted erratically over the Yucatan Peninsula through Saturday evening October 22nd.

   Wilma began to move off the northeast coast of the Yucatan Peninsula on the night of the 22nd, then gradually accelerated northeast over the southern Gulf of Mexico toward South Florida as a strong mid and upper-level trough over the central United States moved south and forced a southwesterly steering flow. The hurricane made landfall as a category 3 storm shortly before 7 AM Monday, October 24th on the southwest Florida coast between Everglades City and Cape Romano with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph and an estimated minimum central pressure of 950 mb. 

  Wilma exhibited a very large 55 to 65 mile-wide eye while crossing the state, and the eye covered large portions of South Florida, including the eastern two-thirds of Collier County, extreme northwestern Miami-Dade County, the southern and eastern third of Hendry County, most of Broward County, and all of Palm Beach County. The eye also clipped the southeastern shore of Lake Okeechobee. The eye wall, the part of the storm with the strongest winds, affected virtually all of South Florida.  Around 10:30 AM, a South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) meteorological station located at the south end of Lake Okeechobee reported sustained winds of 103 mph. Sustained hurricane force winds (74 mph or greater) were observed over all areas except Hendry and Glades counties, and even those two counties measured hurricane force gusts.  The highest recorded gusts were in the 100-120 mph range.  An interesting and revealing aspect of Wilma was the wind field in the eye wall.  The winds on the back (south/west) side of the eye wall were as strong, if not stronger, than those on the front (north/east) side. This goes against the common, but sometimes erroneous, belief that the strongest winds in a hurricane are always in the right-front quadrant of the storm. This occurred over much of South Florida, except for central and southern Miami-Dade County which barely missed the southwestern portion of the eye wall, and likely contributed to the heavier damage across Broward and Palm Beach counties compared to slightly lesser damage across much of Miami-Dade and Collier counties.   

  Wilma moved rapidly northeast across the state, with an average forward speed of 25 mph. Wilma exited the east coast over northeastern Palm Beach County near Palm Beach Gardens around 11 AM Monday October 24th as a Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of around 105 mph.  It traversed the southern peninsula in about 4 hours.

 Rainfall amounts across South Florida generally ranged from 2 to 4 inches across southern sections of the peninsula to 4 to 6 inches across western Collier county and around Lake Okeechobee, with a maximum amount of 7.31 inches in Clewiston.

  The maximum storm surge across the area was mostly south of Chokoloskee in Mainland Monroe county where a storm surge of 13 to 18 feet was forecast. Chokoloskee experienced a storm surge of around 7 feet, which caused extensive flooding. A storm surge of around 8 feet was estimated in Marco Island, with 4 feet in Everglades City. The southeast coast didn't escape the effects of the storm surge, with the tide gauge in Virginia Key reported a maximum surge of around 4 feet. Minor surge flooding was noted in Coconut Grove, Downtown Miami, and Northeast Miami. 

 In Collier, Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach Counties, the winds killed a total of 5 people. Total damage estimates from all the effects range from $9 to $12 billion. Extensive damage to crops was reported, with an estimated $222 million in crop damage for Miami-Dade County alone.

  Damage was widespread, with large trees and power lines down virtually everywhere, causing over 3 million customers to lose power. Structural damage was heaviest in Broward and Palm Beach counties where roof damage and downed or split power poles were noted in some areas. High-rise buildings suffered considerable damage, mainly in the form of broken windows. This was observed mainly along the southeast metro areas, but also in Naples, which underscores the higher wind speeds with height commonly observed in hurricanes. 

  One confirmed tornado was observed in rural Collier County around 2:30 AM on the 24th, moving rapidly northwest from the intersection of U.S. 41 and State Road 29 to the town of Copeland three miles to the north. An F1 intensity was assigned to the tornado as it caused snapped power poles, uprooted large trees, and significantly damaged mobile homes. Small swaths of greater damage elsewhere in South Florida have not been attributed to tornadoes, but were instead likely caused by  "mini-swirls", small vortices within the eye wall that have been observed in previous strong hurricanes such as Hurricane Andrew in 1992.",286

Wilma produced widespread heavy rains of 4 to 8 inches across the area but unseasonably dry conditions prior to Wilma limited flooding.

Wilma developed from a tropical depression near Jamaica, a typical source region for October tropical cyclones, on the afternoon of October 15, 2005. It became the 21st named storm of the season during the morning hours of October 17, 2005, which tied the record for the most named storms in one season originally set back in 1933. Wilma underwent a rapid intensification cycle which began on October 18th and ended in the early morning hours of October 19th, with a central pressure decrease of an incredible 88 mb in only 12 hours!  The central pressure reached 882 mb, making Wilma the most intense hurricane ever in the Atlantic Basin, a full 6 mb lower than Hurricane Gilbert in September 1988. Wilma went on to make landfall on Cozumel Island just off the Yucatan Peninsula as a strong category 4 hurricane on Friday, October 21st, then drifted erratically over the Yucatan Peninsula through Saturday evening October 22nd.

   Wilma began to move off the northeast coast of the Yucatan Peninsula on the night of the 22nd, then gradually accelerated northeast over the southern Gulf of Mexico toward South Florida as a strong mid and upper-level trough over the central United States moved south and forced a southwesterly steering flow. The hurricane made landfall as a category 3 storm shortly before 7 AM Monday, October 24th on the southwest Florida coast between Everglades City and Cape Romano with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph and an estimated minimum central pressure of 950 mb. 

  Wilma exhibited a very large 55 to 65 mile-wide eye while crossing the state, and the eye covered large portions of South Florida, including the eastern two-thirds of Collier County, extreme northwestern Miami-Dade County, the southern and eastern third of Hendry County, most of Broward County, and all of Palm Beach County. The eye also clipped the southeastern shore of Lake Okeechobee. The eye wall, the part of the storm with the strongest winds, affected virtually all of South Florida.  Around 10:30 AM, a South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) meteorological station located at the south end of Lake Okeechobee reported sustained winds of 103 mph. Sustained hurricane force winds (74 mph or greater) were observed over all areas except Hendry and Glades counties, and even those two counties measured hurricane force gusts.  The highest recorded gusts were in the 100-120 mph range.  An interesting and revealing aspect of Wilma was the wind field in the eye wall.  The winds on the back (south/west) side of the eye wall were as strong, if not stronger, than those on the front (north/east) side. This goes against the common, but sometimes erroneous, belief that the strongest winds in a hurricane are always in the right-front quadrant of the storm. This occurred over much of South Florida, except for central and southern Miami-Dade County which barely missed the southwestern portion of the eye wall, and likely contributed to the heavier damage across Broward and Palm Beach counties compared to slightly lesser damage across much of Miami-Dade and Collier counties.   

  Wilma moved rapidly northeast across the state, with an average forward speed of 25 mph. Wilma exited the east coast over northeastern Palm Beach County near Palm Beach Gardens around 11 AM Monday October 24th as a Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of around 105 mph.  It traversed the southern peninsula in about 4 hours.

 Rainfall amounts across South Florida generally ranged from 2 to 4 inches across southern sections of the peninsula to 4 to 6 inches across western Collier county and around Lake Okeechobee, with a maximum amount of 7.31 inches in Clewiston.

  The maximum storm surge across the area was mostly south of Chokoloskee in Mainland Monroe county where a storm surge of 13 to 18 feet was forecast. Chokoloskee experienced a storm surge of around 7 feet, which caused extensive flooding. A storm surge of around 8 feet was estimated in Marco Island, with 4 feet in Everglades City. The southeast coast didn't escape the effects of the storm surge, with the tide gauge in Virginia Key reported a maximum surge of around 4 feet. Minor surge flooding was noted in Coconut Grove, Downtown Miami, and Northeast Miami. 

 In Collier, Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach Counties, the winds killed a total of 5 people. Total damage estimates from all the effects range from $9 to $12 billion. Extensive damage to crops was reported, with an estimated $222 million in crop damage for Miami-Dade County alone.

  Damage was widespread, with large trees and power lines down virtually everywhere, causing over 3 million customers to lose power. Structural damage was heaviest in Broward and Palm Beach counties where roof damage and downed or split power poles were noted in some areas. High-rise buildings suffered considerable damage, mainly in the form of broken windows. This was observed mainly along the southeast metro areas, but also in Naples, which underscores the higher wind speeds with height commonly observed in hurricanes. 

  One confirmed tornado was observed in rural Collier County around 2:30 AM on the 24th, moving rapidly northwest from the intersection of U.S. 41 and State Road 29 to the town of Copeland three miles to the north. An F1 intensity was assigned to the tornado as it caused snapped power poles, uprooted large trees, and significantly damaged mobile homes.

The storm traveled north through southwest Florida through the evening. Effects from Irma were felt across South Florida from September 9th through September 11th. Irma had reached Category 5 strength and a minimum central pressure of 914 MB east of the Bahamas, maintaining Category 5 intensity until landfall along the north coast of Cuba on September 9th. Irma made its first Florida landfall in the Lower Florida Keys early on September 10th as a Category 4 hurricane. ||The strength and size of Hurricane Irma allowed for impacts to be felt across all of South Florida. Irma brought widespread wind damage, heavy rainfall and storm surge to all areas. Hurricane-force sustained wind were measured in much of Collier County, as well as far southern and inland Miami-Dade County, with the possibility of additional hurricane-force sustained wind in more isolated areas over the remainder of South Florida where widespread tropical storm force sustained wind occurred.

Widespread tree damage and some structural damage occurred across all of South Florida, with most structural damage on the minor side.||Irma brought a significant storm surge on both coasts of South Florida. Storm surge of 6 to 8 feet was observed in the Everglades City and Goodland areas of Collier County, with 3 to 5 feet from Marco Island to Naples. Along the east coast, observed storm surge values of 4 to 6 feet were noted along Biscayne Bay from south of Miami to Homestead, and 2 to 4 feet elsewhere along the east coast from Key Biscayne to Palm Beach.||Hurricane Irma brought widespread rainfall and some flooding across the region. From the period between 8 AM EDT September 9th and 8 AM EDT September 11th, 8 to 15 inches of rain were measured over interior portions of Southwest Florida, with estimated amounts of 16 to 20 inches in southwestern Hendry County. This rainfall near the end of a wet summer led to significant flooding over these areas. 5 to 10 inches of rain were noted elsewhere across South Florida, with areas of minor to moderate flooding. ||32 deaths were attributed to Irma in southern Florida, all but one indirect. The only direct death was an 86-year-old man who was knocked down by a gust of wind while opening the front door of his home in Broward County.

However, after approximately a week of slow development, the system moved into warm Gulf of Mexico waters and rapidly intensified into a major hurricane as it moved north towards the Florida Panhandle. After a 2-day long intensification period over the eastern Gulf, Michael made landfall as an unprecedented (for the region) high-end category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in the Florida Panhandle with maximum sustained wind speed of 155 mph and a minimum pressure 919 mb. Based on wind, Michael is the fourth most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind the Labor Day Hurricane (1935), Hurricane Camille (1969) and Hurricane Andrew (1992), and the most powerful storm to impact the Florida Panhandle in recorded history.  Based on central pressure, Michael is the third most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind only the Labor Day Hurricane (1935) and Hurricane Camille (1969).  The storm caused catastrophic damage from wind and storm surge, particularly in the Panama City Beach to Mexico Beach to Cape San Blas areas. The widespread catastrophic damage spread well inland as Hurricane Michael remained at category 3 strength into southwest Georgia.||One of the hardest hit locations was from Mexico Beach to Indian Pass where 9 to 14 feet of peak storm surge inundation was observed. In addition, wave action caused even higher total water values and this resulted in waves destroying the second story of multiple buildings in Mexico Beach.||At St. Joseph Peninsula State Park on Cape San Blas, the storm surge cut through the peninsula, creating two inlets, resulting in portions of the park no longer being accessible by vehicle. These new inlets truly demonstrate the power of storm surge.||While preliminary peak storm surge inundation was slightly less east of Indian Pass, values were still life-threatening and caused significant damage. Along the coast, portions of U.S. 98 and Alligator Drive were washed out and had to be patched/repaved. In Carrabelle, water was high enough to enter a restaurant, resulting in damage to furniture. In addition, numerous homes along the coast were destroyed or damaged as water slammed against the structures.||In addition to the life-threatening storm surge, structural damage was extensive particularly across the Florida Panhandle. Preliminary data assessments indicate almost 50,000 structures were affected across the Florida Panhandle, western Big Bend, southwest Georgia and southeast Alabama. Of these, more than 3,000 structures were destroyed. Homes and businesses were not the only structures impacted. The Hurricane Michael Preliminary Virtual Assessment Team (P-VAT) report from the Structural Extreme Event Reconnaissance Network indicated that two hospitals in Bay County, Bay Medical Sacred Heart and Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center also sustained significant damage. One hospital had glass crack and cladding stripped off the building while the other hospital had issues with power and water. Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB), that experienced the eye of Hurricane Michael, experienced catastrophic damage with every building on base experiencing some roof damage. A nearby elementary school had a portion of its roof ripped off. During the height of the storm, before the transmission stopped, a sensor at Tyndall AFB measured a gust to 139 mph.||The wind damage was not confined to the coastline, but extended well inland. In Marianna, businesses lost their roofs and the exterior wall of some buildings collapsed as the roof was lost. In Donalsonville, GA, where a 115 mph gust was measured, roof damage was also observed and at least one silo was flipped over. Even in Albany, GA, signs were blown down and roofs were peeled off buildings.||In addition to extensive structural damage, hurricane force winds caused widespread power outages across a large portion of the tri-state region. Nearly 100% of customers across a large portion of the Florida Panhandle lost power, with some of these outages lasting weeks. These widespread power outages extended into southwest Georgia with 100% of customers losing power all the way up to Lee County, GA!||Property damage estimates were still being calculated at the time of this publication and will likely rise further from what is indicated here.  However, one estimate of insured losses from the state of Florida alone was as high as $4.2 billion.||The catastrophic winds also resulted in damage to the timber and agricultural communities across Florida and Georgia. According to the Florida Forest Service, in Florida, timber damage costs estimates were over $1.2 billion dollars with almost 3 million acres of forested land damaged. In addition to damage costs, replanting in the more severely damaged areas could be an addition $240 million. This damage also has impacts to the wildfire potential with additional forest fuels from downed trees.   According to Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam, the state suffered nearly $1.5 billion in agricultural damages due to Michael. The estimated damages were as follows: Forestry $1.3 billion, Cotton $49.9 million, Cattle $43.3 million, Peanuts $23 million, Nurseries and Floriculture $16.1 million, Poultry and Eggs $10 million, Vegetables $8.6 million, Other Field Crops $7.3 million, Dairy $6.4 million, Aquaculture $5 million, Fruit $4.4 million, Tree Nuts $4.1 million, and Apiary $2 million. ||In Georgia, 2,368,226 acres of forestland was impacted by Hurricane Michael. The estimated value of this land is $762,683,909. Catastrophic damage was mainly confined to Seminole, Decatur and Miller Counties with severe damage extending into Dougherty and Terrell Counties.  Additional crop damage occurred in Georgia to cotton, vegetables, pecans, poultry, peanuts, and timber.  According to Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, estimated damages were as follows:  Cotton $300-$900 million, Vegetables $480 million, Pecans $560 million, Poultry $25 million, Peanuts $10-$20 million, and Timber $1 billion.||Inland flooding associated with Hurricane Michael across the tri-state region was limited as the hurricane quickly tracked across the area. A maximum rainfall total of 6.84 inches was observed near Crossroads, GA (Quitman County) with the second highest amount for the region recorded in Calhoun County, FL with 6.66 inches. With these higher rainfall amounts isolated, only a few areas of inland flooding were observed. In Bay County, record flooding was observed on the Econfina Creek at State Road 20 with 26.17 feet (NAVD88). This resulted in the SR-20 bridge being overtopped. In addition, in Calhoun County, FL, moderate flooding occurred on the Chipola River near Altha.

In Donalsonville, GA, where a 115 mph gust was measured, roof damage was also observed and at least one silo was flipped over. Even in Albany, GA, signs were blown down and roofs were peeled off buildings.||In addition to extensive structural damage, hurricane force winds caused widespread power outages across a large portion of the tri-state region. Nearly 100% of customers across a large portion of the Florida Panhandle lost power, with some of these outages lasting weeks. These widespread power outages extended into southwest Georgia with 100% of customers losing power all the way up to Lee County, GA!||Property damage estimates were still being calculated at the time of this publication and will likely rise further from what is indicated here.  However, one estimate of insured losses from the state of Florida alone was as high as $4.2 billion.||The catastrophic winds also resulted in damage to the timber and agricultural communities across Florida and Georgia. According to the Florida Forest Service, in Florida, timber damage costs estimates were over $1.2 billion dollars with almost 3 million acres of forested land damaged. In addition to damage costs, replanting in the more severely damaged areas could be an addition $240 million. This damage also has impacts to the wildfire potential with additional forest fuels from downed trees.   According to Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam, the state suffered nearly $1.5 billion in agricultural damages due to Michael. The estimated damages were as follows: Forestry $1.3 billion, Cotton $49.9 million, Cattle $43.3 million, Peanuts $23 million, Nurseries and Floriculture $16.1 million, Poultry and Eggs $10 million, Vegetables $8.6 million, Other Field Crops $7.3 million, Dairy $6.4 million, Aquaculture $5 million, Fruit $4.4 million, Tree Nuts $4.1 million, and Apiary $2 million. ||In Georgia, 2,368,226 acres of forestland was impacted by Hurricane Michael. The estimated value of this land is $762,683,909. Catastrophic damage was mainly confined to Seminole, Decatur and Miller Counties with severe damage extending into Dougherty and Terrell Counties.  Additional crop damage occurred in Georgia to cotton, vegetables, pecans, poultry, peanuts, and timber.  According to Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, estimated damages were as follows:  Cotton $300-$900 million, Vegetables $480 million, Pecans $560 million, Poultry $25 million, Peanuts $10-$20 million, and Timber $1 billion.||Inland flooding associated with Hurricane Michael across the tri-state region was limited as the hurricane quickly tracked across the area. A maximum rainfall total of 6.84 inches was observed near Crossroads, GA (Quitman County) with the second highest amount for the region recorded in Calhoun County, FL with 6.66 inches. With these higher rainfall amounts isolated, only a few areas of inland flooding were observed. In Bay County, record flooding was observed on the Econfina Creek at State Road 20 with 26.17 feet (NAVD88). This resulted in the SR-20 bridge being overtopped. In addition, in Calhoun County, FL, moderate flooding occurred on the Chipola River near Altha. A few homes were impacted downstream from the gauge and significant damage was sustained to the fish camps along the river.

However, after approximately a week of slow development, the system moved into warm Gulf of Mexico waters and rapidly intensified into a major hurricane as it moved north towards the Florida Panhandle. After a 2-day long intensification period over the eastern Gulf, Michael made landfall as an unprecedented (for the region) high-end category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in the Florida Panhandle with maximum sustained wind speed of 155 mph and a minimum pressure 919 mb. Based on wind, Michael is the fourth most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind the Labor Day Hurricane (1935), Hurricane Camille (1969) and Hurricane Andrew (1992), and the most powerful storm to impact the Florida Panhandle in recorded history.

Of these, more than 3,000 structures were destroyed. Homes and businesses were not the only structures impacted. The Hurricane Michael Preliminary Virtual Assessment Team (P-VAT) report from the Structural Extreme Event Reconnaissance Network indicated that two hospitals in Bay County, Bay Medical Sacred Heart and Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center also sustained significant damage.

In Donalsonville, GA, where a 115 mph gust was measured, roof damage was also observed and at least one silo was flipped over. Even in Albany, GA, signs were blown down and roofs were peeled off buildings.||In addition to extensive structural damage, hurricane force winds caused widespread power outages across a large portion of the tri-state region. Nearly 100% of customers across a large portion of the Florida Panhandle lost power, with some of these outages lasting weeks.

However, one estimate of insured losses from the state of Florida alone was as high as $4.2 billion.||The catastrophic winds also resulted in damage to the timber and agricultural communities across Florida and Georgia. According to the Florida Forest Service, in Florida, timber damage costs estimates were over $1.2 billion dollars with almost 3 million acres of forested land damaged. In addition to damage costs, replanting in the more severely damaged areas could be an addition $240 million. This damage also has impacts to the wildfire potential with additional forest fuels from downed trees.   According to Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam, the state suffered nearly $1.5 billion in agricultural damages due to Michael.

The estimated value of this land is $762,683,909. Catastrophic damage was mainly confined to Seminole, Decatur and Miller Counties with severe damage extending into Dougherty and Terrell Counties.  Additional crop damage occurred in Georgia to cotton, vegetables, pecans, poultry, peanuts, and timber.  According to Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, estimated damages were as follows:  Cotton $300-$900 million, Vegetables $480 million, Pecans $560 million, Poultry $25 million, Peanuts $10-$20 million, and Timber $1 billion.||Inland flooding associated with Hurricane Michael across the tri-state region was limited as the hurricane quickly tracked across the area.

With these higher rainfall amounts isolated, only a few areas of inland flooding were observed. In Bay County, record flooding was observed on the Econfina Creek at State Road 20 with 26.17 feet (NAVD88). This resulted in the SR-20 bridge being overtopped.

A peak inundation of 7 to 9 feet above ground level was officially surveyed across some locations in the back bays and sounds of southeast Baldwin County, as well as the northern end of Escambia and Blackwater Bays. A larger area was impacted by 3 to 6 feet of inundation, including along the immediate Gulf facing shores. It should be noted that the extremely heavy rainfall (more details to follow) likely exacerbated the total water levels, although it is difficult to determine the exact extent. Regardless, thousands of structures along coastal areas were flooded by the surge. ||Wind damage was extensive across the region, especially in areas that experienced the eyewall of Sally over a several hour duration. Wind damage was most extensive from southeast Mobile County eastward across Baldwin County AL into Escambia County FL. These locations experienced prolonged hurricane conditions with wind gusts over 100 mph, especially close to the immediate coast. Many homes across the area suffered roof damage from the winds and an untold number of homes were damaged by fallen trees. The tree damage was most extensive in Baldwin County, but also significant in parts of Mobile and Escambia Counties which experienced hurricane conditions. The pecan farms of Baldwin County took a major hit with well over a thousand pecan trees downed throughout the county.||The very slow movement of Sally resulted in rainfall totals of 15 to 30 inches across Baldwin County into the western Florida Panhandle. 7 to 15 inches of rain fell across parts of inland southwest Alabama, along and east of Interstate 65, and south central Alabama. This torrential rain resulted in major river and flash flooding, especially in Baldwin County eastward into the Florida Panhandle. Thousands of water rescues were conducted during the storm due to rapidly rising water and many homes were flooded. Road closures were extensive, especially in Baldwin County east into the western Florida Panhandle and some roads were damaged or washed out. Several rivers reached moderate to major flood stage and some crested within the top 5 of their historical crests. ||There were 3 direct fatalities as a result of Sally. One fatality occurred in the Wolf Bay area (Baldwin County AL.) Two men were riding the storm out on their boat and at some point during the storm attempted to swim to shore. One of the men made it to a pier and was rescued and hospitalised; the other man drowned. The second fatality occurred on Innerarity Point, FL (Escambia County FL) where a 45 year old woman drowned when the vehicle she was driving was overtaken by the incoming storm surge. The third fatality occurred in Perdido Key, FL (Escambia County FL) when a 27 year old man drowned trying to retrieve a boat that was swept away by the surge and high surf. ||There were also 3 indirect fatalities. One was due to storm cleanup in the Foley, AL area with two others (one in both Baldwin County and Escambia County FL) due to carbon monoxide poisoning from improper generator use.||The total reported damage from Public Assistance (PA) and Individual Assistance (IA) is near $550 million. Note that this does not include insured losses and damages. Also, not all county reports were available or finalized at the time of this publication. A breakdown of costs related to each individual hazard was unavailable. All damages are listed under either the Hurricane or Tropical Storm hazard, but it should be noted that a good portion of the damage was caused by storm surge or flooding even though it is not explicitly listed. ||Timber loss was extensive. The Alabama Forestry Commission estimates that 2,440 forested acres were damaged with 79,175 tons of timber destroyed at a value of $1,564,160. Most of this occurred in Baldwin County. ||A study by the University of Florida estimates that total agricultural losses in the western Florida Panhandle ranged from $55 to $100 million.||Here is a breakdown of county by county impacts:||Mobile County AL: The greatest impact of Sally in Mobile County was to Dauphin Island, which was impacted by the western eyewall of Sally for a long duration. Hurricane force winds with gusts over 100 mph were recorded on the island. Winds were out of the north, which resulted in the bay and sound side of the island being the most impacted. Several buildings experienced roof and siding damage, including to two buildings on the campus of the Dauphin Island Sea Lab. Another home on the island lost its roof entirely. A 3 to 4 foot storm surge on the north side of the island resulted in major damage to docks and piers, including at the Dauphin Island marina. Across mainland Mobile county, the southern and central portions of the county experienced a long duration of sustained tropical storm force winds with hurricane force wind gusts recorded all the way west at the Mobile Regional Airport. In fact, the 82 mph gust recorded at the airport was almost as high as the peak gust recorded in Hurricane Katrina of 83 mph. Numerous trees and power lines were downed across the county, especially in central and southern parts of the county. This resulted in widespread power outages. Mobile's Bienville Square suffered major damage to the numerous oaks in the area and there was minor damage reported at some businesses in downtown Mobile. Several homes in the county also experienced roof, siding, and fence damage. Downed trees also damaged some homes. ||Baldwin County AL: The county experienced widespread damage as the eye of Sally moved across a large portion of the county after making landfall in Gulf Shores, AL. A large|storm surge resulted in widespread inundation and major flood damage to structures along the back bay waters with little to no structural damage to buildings along the Gulf facing beaches. There was a walkway at the Cotton Bayou Gulf access that was damaged. The greatest surge occurred east of Gulf Shores across Orange Beach to the Florida State line and all the way north into the northern portion of Perdido Bay, as well as Wolf Bay. Peak inundation was surveyed to be 7 to 9 feet above ground with a much larger area that experienced 3 to 6 feet of inundation. Surge values neared 10 feet above ground at the far western end of Cotton Bayou in Orange Beach. Numerous large boats were moved onto land by the surge. Almost all piers were destroyed and several marinas were heavily damaged. The Gulf State Park Pier in Gulf Shores was also majorly damaged with a large section of the pier now missing. The 20 to 30 inches of rain that fell across the southern part of the county certainly compounded the storm surge flooding and also resulted in widespread flash flooding and river flooding. The Fish and Styx Rivers reached major flood stage and experienced their third and second highest crests respectively. The eyewall of Sally resulted in widespread and extensive damage to trees and power lines. Most of southern Baldwin county experienced sustained hurricane force winds of 75 to 85 mph with gusts over 100 mph. A sailboat anchored in Ingram Bayou measured a 1 minute sustained wind of 113 mph with a gust to 137 mph. These measurements were recorded at an elevated 58 feet. When reduced to the standard measuring height 33 feet, the sustained wind is estimated to have been 104 mph with a gust to 126 mph. The Center of Severe Weather Research recorded a 123 mph gust on the east side of the Perdido Pass bridge from an anemometer on their mobile doppler radar unit with sustained winds of 93 mph. Numerous structures were damaged by fallen trees and many structures in the county suffered significant roof and siding damage. In Ft. Morgan, a few older homes were destroyed and a boat storage facility at a marina suffered major damage. Almost all of the county lost power during the storm due to substantial damage to the power infrastructure. The pecan farming industry took a devastating hit as likely over a thousand pecan trees were destroyed across the county. There were three fatalities from the storm, one direct and two indirect. A person drowned in Orange Beach during the storm. Another fatality occurred in Foley during the post storm clean up and another individual died due to carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator.||Escambia County FL: A combination of strong wind and storm surge resulted in widespread damage to Escambia County. To date, 1,756 structures were damaged. 44 structures were destroyed and 629 suffered major damage. Hurricane force winds resulted in siding and roof damage to many structures, with downed trees also playing a large role in damage to some structures. Power outages were widespread. Pensacola NAS recorded sustained hurricane force winds with gusts of 92 mph. A large storm surge impacted the county, with the highest surge occurring in the Perdido Key area and along portions of Pensacola and Escambia Bays. Peak inundation of 7 to 9 feet above ground level was surveyed across the northern portions of Pensacola, Escambia, and Blackwater Bays. The tidal gauge at the Port of Pensacola measured an inundation of 5.6 feet, the third highest surge ever recorded (Ivan and the 1926 hurricane are #1 and #2.) Numerous structures had significant damage from storm surge inundation. Numerous large boats and barges were moved onto land by the surge. A portion of the Three Mile bridge across Pensacola Bay collapsed due to damage from the barges. The vast majority of the storm surge structural damage occurred along the back bays and sounds and not along the immediate Gulf facing beaches. However, significant damage occurred along the Gulf islands national seashore, particularly in the Johnson Beach and Ft. Pickens area. On Johnson Beach, the surge and wave action took out a large portion of the first line of dunes with damage even noted to some of the second line dunes. 4 to 5 ft of sand covered Johnson Beach road with damage to the road itself. Noaa aerial imagery indicates that 3 new cuts were created on the far east side of Johnson Beach. The surge along the Gulf side of Perdido Key was also significant (7-9 feet) as the water line encroached upon the entrance of some of the condos and damaged walkways and pools. The copious amounts of rain (15-30 inches) also compounded the storm surge issue as water that normally would drain into area bays, rivers, creeks, and streams had nowhere to go due to the incoming storm surge. Downtown Pensacola was one notable area hard hit by this fresh water flooding, but countless other locations, especially across central and southern Escambia county, were also hard hit by this flooding. There were 3 reported fatalities, two direct and one indirect. One person died while trying to retrieve a boat during the storm and another person died while kayaking during the storm. One person died after the storm due to carbon monoxide from a generator being run indoors.||Santa Rosa County, FL: A large storm surge had its greatest impact on the sound and bay|sides of Santa Rosa county. The largest surge occurred in the northern half of Escambia Bay as well as in Blackwater and East Bay. Peak surge inundation reached 7 to 9 feet above ground level. Numerous homes suffered significant inundation from the surge. The surge flooding was compounded by 20+ inches of rain that fell which also resulted in significant to major flash flooding and river flooding. Hurricane force wind gusts also resulted in roof and siding damage to many homes, extensive downed trees, and power lines. To date, around 1,400 residential structures have been identified as being impacted with 6 being destroyed and 139 suffering major damage. 19 commercial buildings have been documented as being impacted with major damage to 4 buildings. ||Okaloosa County, FL: A long duration of tropical storm force winds impacted Okaloosa County as the center of Hurricane Sally tracked very slowly to the east and north of the county. Significant storm surge impacted coastal areas, especially in western parts of Okaloosa county closer to the Santa Rosa line. Many homes on the sound side of the Mary Esther area were inundated by the surge flooding. Portions of Highway 98 on Okaloosa Island were breached by the surge flooding, however the road was not damaged. A 2 ft seawall was breached in Ft. Walton Beach with 2 to 3 ft of water covered adjacent portions of Highway 98. Walkovers and beach side docks were displaced on the Gulf side. A few restaurants and homes suffered some flooding along Calhoun avenue, likely from a combination of the torrential rainfall and storm surge. The copious rainfall also resulted in flash flooding and major river flooding, which also flooded homes in the county.||Escambia County, AL:|Widespread trees were downed throughout Escambia county, AL. Some of the trees fell onto homes, but most of the damage was minor. However, 4 homes suffered major damage from the fallen trees. At the peak of the event, 85% of the county was without power. Torrential rainfall|of 10 to 20 inches led to flash flooding and river flooding, resulting in the 10 county roads becoming impassable during the storm. Some of the roads suffered wash outs. A couple of bridges experienced wash outs as well.||Covington County, AL:|Five homes suffered wind damage as tropical storm force winds impacted Covington county. Trees and power lines were downed which resulted in some power outages. Numerous roads were flooded and impassable. Several roads also suffered wash outs due to the extensive flooding.|||Crenshaw County, AL: Tropical storm force wind gusts downed some trees and power lines in|the county. Significant flooding also occurred, especially in the southern half of the county. Numerous roads were impassable and some experienced washouts.||Monroe County, AL: Tropical storm conditions downed numerous trees and power lines|across Monroe county.||Clarke County, AL:  Tropical storm force winds downed trees across Clarke county. One tree|fell onto a home in Grove Hill, resulting in significant damage.||Conecuh County, AL: Tropical storm force winds downed trees and power lines in Conecuh County.||Butler County, AL:  Tropical storm conditions downed trees and power lines across portions of Butler county. A few homes suffered minor damage from fallen trees. Scattered power outages were reported. A few roads were flooded from heavy rain.",340

Ian moved off the east coast of Florida just north of Cape Canaveral during the mid-morning hours of Thursday, September 29th. ||Ian produced a catastrophic storm surge across coastal sections of SW Florida on Wednesday, September 28th. Storm surge from surveys was estimated in the 8-11 ft range above MHHW along the Gulf beaches from Naples north to Barefoot Beach, and extending inland about 1 mile. Storm surge of 4-7 ft above MHHW was surveyed in the Naples Bay area and extending north to the Naples Airport area, as well as in North Naples near the Cocohatchee River. Farther south and east along the coast, storm surge values were estimated at 5-7 feet above MHHW in Marco Island and Goodland, and 4-6 ft MHHW in Everglades City and Chokoloskee.||Wind gusts as high as 110 mph were measured in the Naples area at heights well above the standard surface elevation of 33 feet. Sustained winds in the 70-75 mph range likely occurred in NW Collier County as well as far western sections of Hendry and Glades counties. Elsewhere across South Florida, peak winds were generally in the 45-70 mph range. ||A total of 13 reported tornadoes were spawned by Ian on Tuesday, September 27th and early on Wednesday, September 28th as it was approaching the SW Florida coast, the strongest being an EF-2 in the Delray Beach area of Palm Beach County. ||Storm total rainfall amounts from 8 AM on September 26th to 8 AM on September 29th ranged from 4 to 10 inches across southern Florida. The highest rainfall amounts occurred in the day or two leading up to the storm's landfall, with highest values over western metro Broward County in the 8-10 inch range, as well as in parts of the city of Miami.||All of the associated effects of Ian in southern Florida resulted in 10 fatalities, at least 2 injuries, $2.2 billion in property damage, and at least $500,000 in crop damage. The vast majority of the damage was likely caused by the significant to major storm surge in Collier County. Of the 10 deaths, 2 were directly caused by the storm surge in Collier County, and the remaining 8 were indirectly caused by the storm during evacuation, preparation, and clean-up activities. The 13 associated tornadoes resulted in 2 injuries an estimated $2.5 million in property damage.||Six people were injured at South Pointe Pier Park on Miami Beach on September 30th by large waves caused by swells from the back side of Ian.",343
