The initial severe storms developed in Hernando County, where several trees were knocked down in Spring Hill (245 PM EDT), and soon after a fence was blown down on a property along Ronda Street in Spring Hill (311 PM EDT).  

About two hours later, another strong thunderstorm developed east of Tampa in Valrico, courtesy of the local Bay breeze.  The sustained updraft produced multiple hail reports, including several ranging from dime to quarter size, between 424 PM and 442 PM EDT.  Soon after, the outflow from this storm met with outflows from other cells to the north, allowing another cell to develop near Brandon and drift west toward east Tampa.  This cell produced nickel size hail in Brandon at the Town Center Mall near interstate 75 (502 PM EDT), and a few minutes later in Progress Village (505 PM EDT).  Torrential rains associated with this storm caused local, but minor, flooding of roads and parking lots in Brandon near Interstate 75.

Lightning from these storms ignited several small brush fires, including one of 8 acres near Gibsonton along Interstate 75.  

Isolated storms well north (Levy and Citrus Co) and east (Highlands Co) produced three quarter to one inch diameter hail during the same episode.  Penny size hail fell in Lecanto at 215 PM EDT; quarter-size hail in Chiefland at 450 PM EDT; and dime size hail in Lorida at 640 PM EDT.",377
